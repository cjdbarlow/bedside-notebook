The upper limb is supplied by the **brachial plexus**:
* Formed by the anterior primary rami of **C5 to T1**
	* Variably C4 to T2
* Divided into roots, trunks, devisions, cords, and branches  
Blocking the plexus at different levels will give a different distribution of sensory block.
* Runs between the clavicle and third rib
* Runs with the axillary artery into the upper limb, where it forms the major terminal branches

###Sections of Brachial Plexus
The brachial plexus has **five** key sections:
* **Five** roots  
The nerve roots that give rise to the plexus. May be imaged as they emerge from the vertebral foramen.
* **Three** trunks  
Roots merge together to form three trunks:
	* May be imaged at the **interscalene** level  
	Deep to SCM, between anterior and middle scalene. Key landmarks:
		* Lateral border of SCM
		* Scalenus anterior
		* Interscalene groove
	* Superior trunk  
	From C5 & C6.
	* Middle trunk  
	From C7.
	* Inferior trunk  
	From C8 and T1.
* **Six divisions**  
Three anterior and three posterior, which then re-merge to form the cords.
	* Lie posterior and cephalad to the subclavian artery
	* May be **imaged** either **supraclavicular** or **infraclavicular**
* **Three cords**  
Imaged at the wrapping around the axillary artery, and include:
	* Lateral cord
	* Posterior cord
	* Medial cord
* **Branches**  
	* Divided into major and minor terminal branches
	* Major terminal branches may be **imaged** in the **axilla**




###Major Terminal Branches
The major terminal branches include:
* Radial nerve
	* Sensation to the dorsum of the hand, generally the lateral 2.5 digits.
	* Motor: Extension of elbow and fingers
* Median nerve  
	* Sensation to the palm, and the palmar surface and dorsum of the distal phalanges of the lateral 3.5 digits
	* Motor: Flexion of fingers
* Ulnar nerve
	* Sensation to the medial 1.5 fingers, the ulnar border of the hand (including the dorsum), and sometimes the ulnar part of the forearm
	* Motor: Flexion of 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> digits and opposition of 1<sup>st</sup> digit
	* Most effectively blocked with a targeted axillary block
* Musculocutaneous nerve
	* Sensation to the lateral aspect of the forearm
	* Motor: Flexion and supination of forearm
* Axillary nerve
	* Sensation over the "regimental patch" of the shoulder



###Minor Terminal Branches
From the roots:
* Dorsal scapular nerve
* Long thoracic nerve
* Branch to phrenic nerve


From the trunks:
* Nerve to subclavius
* Suprascapular nerve


From the cords:
* Lateral pectoral nerve
* Subscapular nerve
* Thoracodorsal nerve
* Median pectoral nerve
* Intercostal brachial nerve  
* Medial brachial cutaneous nerve
* Medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve
Supplies upper medial part of the forearm, and can be covered with a subcutaneous bleb just distal to the axillary hairline.
