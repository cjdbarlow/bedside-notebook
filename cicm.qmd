# CICM Final Exam

The CICM final exam consists of a:

* Written exam\
Aims to **assess knowledge**.
	* Two 150 minute/15 question SAQ papers
	* 10 minutes reading time
* Oral viva\
Aims to **assess judgment**.
	* Eight 10 minute stations\
	Always:
		* Radiology
		* Communication
			* Consistently has a high maximal mark\
			Opportunity to do very well.
			* Determine what sort of meeting this is
		* Equipment
	* 2 minutes reading time per station
		* Radiology viva reading time is reviewing images
	* Break stations
		* 1 break after communication station
* Hot case\
Aims to **assess wisdom** and real-world clinical decision making.

### Glossary of Terms

## Oral Exam

### Viva

{{< include /includes/viva.qmd >}}

:::column-margin
:::tick
Complete the CICM Communication Course prior to the exam; the communication viva scenario generally mirrors the course scenarios.

### Hot Case

The hot case is the only part of the exam that assesses a candidate at the bedside. Hot cases are:

* Challenging
* Artificial\
The scenario is clearly unrealistic - suspend your disbelief.
* Incompletely correlated with clinical skill\
Hot case performance does not equal clinical performance, however hot case practice â†‘ hot case performance.
* Routinely performed poorly
	* 60-70% of candidates pass
	* 30% of candidates pass both cases
* Fundamentally a vibe check\
This is a test of "are you ready to be left in charge of the unit." It is not a test of your ability to detect some arcane diagnosis.


The case itself consists of several stages:

:::column-margin
The end-of-bed-o-gram and orbit provide the majority of useful clinical information, do not neglect them. Touching the patient is expected to occur at some point however, usually by the 2-3 minute mark.
:::

:::column-margin
My impression is that the most important stage of the hot case is the presentation - a good presentation can redeem a mediocre exam, but a good response to questioning can redeem neither.
:::

* **Clinical question**\
Brief stem with incomplete information, and a clinical question.
* **Reading time**\
2 minutes. Decide:
	* What **potential clinical problems** may this patient have?
	* What **part** of the **exam**ination should be **focus**ed on?
	* Likely follow-up questions
* **Entrance**
	* Lights
	* Gel hands
	* Introduce yourself:
		* To the patient
		* To the nurse
	* Ask about relevant **position restrictions** and **languages barriers**
* **End-of-bed-o-gram**\
Stand at the foot of the bed and identify key room equipment.
* **Orbit**\
Circle the bed space to identify:
	* Infusions
		* Nutrition
	* Monitor\
	Ask for **fevers**.
	* Ventilation\
	Ask about:
		* **Sputum**
		* Ventilator settings, if unfamiliar
	* Catheters and drains\
	Ask for:
		* **Urine output**
		* Drain output
* **Clinical examination**\
	* Begin with adequate exposure
	* Structured approach
	* Can ask key, targeted, relevant questions\
	Must be balanced.
		* Too many unnecessary or boilerplate questions suggest a lack of direction or thought
		* Too few questions means key information may not be provided
* **Intermission**\
Brief period during which:
	* PPE is doffed
	* Hand hygiene occurs
	* The clock is stopped
	* You can collate your thoughts and prepare the presentation
* **Presentation**\
3-5 minute presentation that should be concise, comprehensive, and *rapidly* delivered. This should:
	* Open with a **brief**, 1-2 sentence **introduction** that provides an overview of the clinical scenario\
	This is your opportunity to demonstrate that you have identified the major issues.
	* **Answer the question**\
	This should occur even if the answer is not clear - a precise answer will often be contingent on the availability and interpretation of ancillary information, which you do not have access to.
	* Provide a **rationale** for the answer\
	Signposted, systematic description of the justifications for that answer.
	* Outline any **caveats**\
	Signposted, systematic list of any concerns that may impact your decision, and how you plan to investigate them.
	* Finish with a **list of relevant** positive and negative **findings from the** clinical **examination**
* **Further questioning**

The hot case is like a tennis match in that the only part of the game that you can control is the serve - these are the examination and the opening of the presentation. Maximise this time.
