# Neuroprognostication {#sec-neuroprog}

:::info
This is an overview of neuroprognostication. It is generally tailored to cardiac arrest, although there is substantial overlap with TBI prognostication.
:::

Accurate prediction of neurological outcome is difficult and critical:

* Neurological outcome is a major determinant of quality of life and ongoing healthcare needs
* Overly pessimistic prognosis leads to withdrawal of life sustaining therapy in patients who could potentially recover
* Overly optimistic views lead to prolongation of support in patients with futile prognosis\
Consequential ↑ healthcare-associated suffering:
	* Individual loss of dignity
	* Invasiveness of intensive care
	* Familial exhaustion


## Outcome Assessment

Scales used to assess neurological outcome include:

:::column-margin
The definition of a good outcome changed circa 2006; studies older than this typically include severe disability as a good outcome.
:::

* Glasgow Outcome Scale\
Largely deprecated.
* **Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended**\
* **Cerebral Performance Categories**\
Derived from the Glasgow Outcome Score, and used after cardiac arrest.
	* Typically, a **good outcome** includes **moderate or minor** disability (CPC 1-2)

## Clinical Examination

:::caution
Clinical examination is interfered with by hypothermia, sedation, analgesics, and muscle relaxants.
:::

Relevant features of the neurological exam include:

* Cranial nerve findings
	* **Pupillary** reflexes
	* **Corneal** reflexes
* **Motor score**
* **Myoclonus**
	* *Status* myoclonus involves synchronised, repetitive, symmetric, persistent (>30 minutes) jerking with clinical coma
		* EEG may show status or general malignant pattern
		* Specific for poor neurological outcome

## Investigations

**Laboratory**:

* Bloods
	* Neuron Specific Enolase
		* Serial measurements demonstrating repeated and ↑ levels predict poor outcome
		* Confounded by haemolysis and neuroendocrine tumours
		* Unclear prognostic value

**Imaging**:

:::column-margin
Functional investigations (**neurological exam**, **SSEPs**, EEG) are generally superior to radiology at predicting outcome but more affected by confounding.
\
In general, radiological tests are more useful for diagnosis than prognostication.
:::

* CT Brain\
	* Logistically easier than MRI
	* Can be performed earlier and repeatedly\
	Features ↑ over 3-5 days as oedema evolves.
	* Features of HIE include:
		* Loss of grey/white differentiation\
		Cytotoxic oedema ↓ grey matter density.
		* Diffuse oedema
			* Effacement of ventricles and sulci
		* Herniation
			* Tonsillar
			* Trans-tentorial
		* Pseudo-subarachnoid haemorrhage pattern\
		↑ Density of basal cisterns due to ↑↑ ICP, usually occurring with generalised oedema.
* MRI Brain
	* Prognostically useful if no HIE on CT brain
	* Optimal time is 2-7 days after arrest
	* Features include:
		* Early: ↑ DWI intensity and diffusion restriction\
			* Presence is highly specific for a poor outcome
			* Absence of DWI lesions is reasonably specific for a good 6-month functional outcome
			* Changes may pseudonormalise at 7 days
		* Late: ↑ T2/FLAIR intensity

**Other**:

:::column-margin
EEG and SSEP are covered in detail under @sec-eeg and @sec-ssep.
:::

* EEG
	* Most useful 24 hours after cardiac arrest
	* Generally falsely improve over time, ↓ diagnostic utility
	* Sedatives should be withheld for several half-lives prior to obtaining recording
* SSEP
	* Most useful 24 hours after arrest in patients with an **abnormal EEG**
	* Retains accuracy under sedation
	* Contraindicated by cervical spine abnormality
	* ↓ Accuracy after TBI due to presence of spinal or subcortical lesion


## Approach

:::info
* The best predictor of future improvement is past improvement
* Earlier (hours) improvement is better than late (days) improvement
:::

Neuroprognostication is difficult, and:

* Relies on a combination of:
	* Clinical examination findings
	* Structural investigations
	* Functional investigations
* Becomes **more accurate with time**\
Approach is correspondingly split into:
	* Early\
	\<72 hours. Management is supportive unless unequivocal evidence of dismal outcome.
	* Late
	* Indeterminate


### Early

:::info
* Minimise **confounders**
* **Obtain** prognostic **information**
:::

Principles:

* Supportive intensive care
* Avoid assessment in the setting of hypothermia\
e.g. Post-arrest TTM.
* Early **family meeting** to **set expectations** around:
	* Time required for prognostication
	* Likelihood of significant brain injury
* Gain prognostic information
	* CT
	* MRI
	* EEG\
	Ideally at 12, 24, 48 hours.


Early prognostication by  *may* be possible if there is:

* Brain death
* Unequivocal evidence of catastrophic brain injury
* Localisation or withdrawal\
Favours good prognosis.


### Late

:::info
* Exclude **confounders**
* Evaluate predictors of good and poor outcome
* Decisions guided by family input around patients wishes and acceptable quality of life
:::

Principles:

* Rule out confounders
	* Drugs
		* Sedatives and analgesics
		* Deliriogenic medications
	* Neurological
		* Seizures
			* NCSE
	* Metabolic causes
		* Electrolyte abnormalities
		* Hepatic encephalopathy
		* Uraemic encephalopathy
		* Acidosis\
		Particularly metabolic.
* Complete any outstanding investigations
* Neurological exam at 72 hours



**Good outcome** is *more likely* with **any of**:

* M4/5
* MRI with at worst isolated DWI lesion
* EEG continuous background <12 hours from ROSC
* EEG reactive background <24 hours from ROSC
* N20 SSEP >4μV >48 hours from ROSC


**Poor outcome** is **very likely** with clinical picture of severe widespread brain injury and:

* Bilateral unreactive pupils >72 hours from ROSC
* Bilateral absent N20 SEEP >48 hours from ROSC


**Poor outcome** is **likely** with clinical picture of severe widespread brain injury and:

* CT with diffuse loss of grey-white differentiation and sulcal effacement >48 hours from ROSC
* MRI-DWI with diffuse restricted diffusion at 2-7 days post ROSC
* EEG with background or burst suppression >72 hours from ROSC


### Indeterminate

Continue support and observation if:

* There are no reliable predictors of poor outcome
* More time needed to ascertain patients wishes


## Key Studies

**Hypothermia**:

* Patients with cardiac arrest *due* to hypothermia have good outcomes despite prolonged resuscitation
* Hypothermia has several potentially beneficial effects:
	* Anticonvulsant
	* Anti-inflammatory
		* ↓ Cerebral oedema and ICP
	* ↓ CMRO~2~ and ↓ HIE
* Hypothermia also has several potential harms
	* ↓ HR and ↓ CO
	* Arrhythmias
		* ↑ QTc
	* ↓ Immune function
	* ↓ Rate of drug metabolism
	* Hyperglycaemia
