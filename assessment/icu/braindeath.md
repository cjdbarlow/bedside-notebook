#Brain Death Testing

>This is specific to brain death in the Australian context. Additionally:
>* Diagnosis must be made by independent examination of 2 suitable trained nad experienced doctors
>* Time of death is the completion of examination by the second doctor

**Brain Death** is the irreversible loss of all functions of the brain, including brainstem. Diagnosis requires:
* **Preconditions**  
Must be met prior to diagnosis.
	* A **brain lesion consistent with a diagnosis of brain death**  
	Neuroimaging consistent with acute brain pathology that could ause brain death.
	* Normothermia  
	≥ 36.5°C.
	* Normotensive 
	SBP ≥90mmHg/MAP >60mmHg.
	* No sedation, analgesia 
	May also require normal renal or hepatic function, or prolonged period off sedation if unsure. Drug antagonists can be used.
	* No muscle relaxation  
	Confirm with train-of-four.
	* Absence of metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte derangements
	* Ability to assess brain stem reflexes  
	At least one eye and ear.
	* Ability to perform apnoea test  
	Neuromuscular system capable of independent respiration (e.g. no high cervical spine injury), saturations able to be maintained with supplemental oxygen.
* **Coma**  
GCS 3, with no response to pain in both central (supraorbital) and peripheral distributions.
* **Absence** of **brainstem reflexes**
	* Pupils fixed and non-reactive
	* No corneal reflex
	* No oculo-vestibular reflexes  
	Cold ice water injected into each EAM via a small catheter until either:
		* Nystagmus  
		Slow-phase towards irrigated ear in intact brainstem.
		* Ocular deviation
		* 20mL given
	* No gag
	* No cough
* **Apnoea**  
Apnoea testing:
	* Preoxygenated with 100% O<sub>2</sub>
	* Ventilator disconnected whilst delivering 100% O<sub>2</sub> at 6L/min through a suction catheter close to the carina
	* Confirmed positive when there is no respiratory effort when:
		* PaCO<sub>2</sub> is ≥60mmHg, OR
		* PaCO<sub>2</sub> has risen 20mmHg above baseline


##Investigations
Cerebral perfusion imaging is used when brain death cannot be determined due to ***preconditions* not met**. Key investigations:
* 4-vessel angiogram  
Demonstrating absence of flow above the carotid siphon in the anterior circulation and foramen magnum in the posterior circulation.
* Tc-99 HMPAO Spect  
Lack of perfusion in the brain parenchyma.
* Transcranial Doppler  
Screening test for appropriateness of performing CT. Demonstration of blood flow rules out diagnosis of brain death.
