#Pre-Anaesthetic Assessment

*This section covers identification of medical issues that influence anaesthetic technique and outcome. Management of identified issues is covered under [perioperative management](/anaesthesia/periop/periop-management.md).*

Preoperative assessment can be divided into:
* History
* Examination

##History
This assessment template uses the mnemonic **IIF AMPLE**. Fasting status is in there twice, to ensure it's not forgotten.

* **Identification** of the patient
* **Indication** for surgery
* **Fasting** status


* **Allergies**  
	* Including issues with **previous anaesthetic**
	* **Family history** of **anaesthetic issues**
		* MH
		* Atypical cholinesterase
		* Other reactions
* **Medications**  
Perioperative management of medication is covered [here](/anaesthesia/considerations/periop-med.md). In particular, evaluate:
	* Respiratory drugs
	* Cardiac drugs
	* Opioid/analgesic use and tolerance
	* Antiplatelet and anticoagulant use
	* Drugs with many side-effects or interactions
	* Alcohol use
	* Drug use
* **Past Medical History**
	* Previous surgeries
	* Previous anaesthetics
		* Previous airway management difficulty
		* PONV
	* Respiratory disease
		* Asthma  
		Increased risk of bronchospasm from intubation & desflurane
			* Consider cancellation or delaying elective procedures in poorly controlled asthma
		* Smoking  
		Impaired mucous secretion & clearance, decreased small airway calibre, altered immune response.
		* COAD  
		Increased risk of atelectasis, bronchospasm, pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, respiratory failure.
		* Recent URTI
		* OSA  
		Screening should be performed with the STOP-BANG questionaire. 
	* Cardiac disease
		* CAD  
		CCS Angina class.
		* MI  
		 Recommend postponing elective operations 4-6/52 following an MI - increased risk of reinfarction/death (periop MI mortality is 20-50%).
		 	* <3/12: 37% chance reinfarction
		 	* 3-6/12: 15% chance reinfarction
		 	* Over 6/12: Constant 5% risk
		 	* If surgery cannot be avoided, post-op ICU monitoring decreases risk to 6%, 2%, 1% respectively
		* CHF  
		NYHA class.
		* Valvular disease
		* Arrhythmias
		* PVD
		* Exercise tolerance
	* Neurological disease
		* Seizures
		* CVA
		* Raised ICP
		* Spinal disease
		* Neuromuscular disease
	* MSK
		* Obesity  
		Obesity is associated increased rates of multiple complications. Perioperative evaluation should include:
			* Screening for OSA
			* HbA1c and Hb
			* Potential for difficult intubation
		* Arthropathies
		* Cervical spine disease  
		Abscess, trauma, tumours, scleroderma, obesity fixation.
	* Endocrine disease
		* Diabetes  
			* Check and test HbA1c in known diabetics with planned major orthopaedic or vascular surgery
			* Evaluate for complications:
				* CVS
				* Renal
				* Neuropathy
		* Thyroid
		* Adrenal
	* Renal
		* Insufficiency  
		Perioperative AKI is more likely with:
			* Age
			* Emergency surgery
			* Obesity
			* Smoking
			* ETOH abuse
			* DM
			* HTN
			* Anaemia
			* Elevated Urea/Creatinine ratios
		* Dialysis
	* GIT
		* GORD
		* Hepatic disease
	* Haematological diseases
		* Objection to blood products
		* History of bleeding problems  
		Asking patients about their risk of bleeding is a sensitive tool to identify patients with impaired haemostasis or platelet function.
		* Anaemia
		* Coaguolpathy
		* Dyscrasias
	* Pregnancy
		* Issues with this pregnancy
		* Issues with previous pregnancies
		* Problems with prior epidurals
* **Last eaten**
* **Events**  
Of the last 24 hours and concurrent illnesses.

##Examination
Examination follows an ABCDE approach:
* Airway assessment:
	* **Previous grade** of intubation
	* Ability to assume sniffing position/cervical spine stiffness
	* Mallampati:
		1: Full visibility of tonsils, uvula and soft palate
		2: Visibility of hard and soft palate, upper portion of tonsils and uvula
		3: Soft and hard palate and base of uvula visible
		4: Only hard palate visible
	* Thyromental distance  
	Distance of lower mandible in the midline from the mentum to the thyroid notch.
		* < 6cm is associated with difficult intubation
	* Mouth opening
		* < 2 finger breadths is associated with difficult intubation
	* Tongue size
	* Dentition
* Breathing assessment
* CVS asssessment
* Neuro assessment
* Extremity assessment
	* Cannula sites
	* Bony landmarks and anatomy for regional techniques
* Fluid state
	* Filling state
	* Nutritional state

##Checklist
An alternative pre-anaesthetic/peri-operative checklist is also described using the mnemonic A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>D<sub>2</sub>E<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>G<sub>2</sub>:
* **Affirmative history**
	* Surgical condition
	* Past illnesses and treatment
* **Airway**
	* Perform a detailed airway exam
* **Blood loss**
	* Current Hb
	* Blood loss estimation
	* Blood availability
* **Breathing**
	* Respiratory examination
* **Clinical exam**  
	* Cardiac examination
	* Exertional tolerance
* **Co-morbidities**  
Particualarly DM, HTN, asthma, epilepsy.
* **Drugs**  
Current medications and anaesthesia plan.
* **Details**  
Of previous anaesthetics and surgeries.
* **Evaluate** investigations  
Other relevant investigations.
* **End point** to take up the case for surgery  
Conduct operation if further postponement will not be beneficial.
* **Fluid** status
* **Fasting** status
* **Give** physical status
* **Get consent**
