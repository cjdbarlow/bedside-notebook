**Brain Death**:
* Requires absence of:
	* Brain stem reflexes
	* Motor responses
	* Respiratory drive
	* Apnoeic  
	Must be confirmed with apnoea testing:
		* Preoxygenated with 100% O<sub>2</sub>
		* Ventilator disconnected whilst delivering 100% O<sub>2</sub> at 6L/min through a suction catheter close to the carina
		* Confirmed positive when there is no respiratory effort when:
			* PaCO<sub>2</sub> is >60mmHg, OR
			* PaCO<sub>2</sub> has risen 20mmHg above baseline
* In a patient who is:
	* Normothermic  
	> 36.5°C.
	* Normotensive 
	SBP >100mmHg.
	* Euvolaemic
	* Eucapnoeic
	* Normoxic
	* Non-drugged
	* Comatose
	* Free of other contributing metabolic derangements
* When there is a brain lesion which would be **consistent with a diagnosis brain death**
