#Airway Assessment

> * Airway assessment should always be performed
> * Predicting an anatomically difficult airway is unreliable
> 	* When a predicted difficult airway exists, a plan should be developed to manage that particular difficulty
> * Previous difficulty with a technique is the greatest predictor of difficulty with that technique

Airway assessment involves identifying potential:
* [Anatomical difficulty](#anat)  
* [Physiological difficulty](#phys)
* [Situational difficulty](#env)

##Anatomical Difficulty {#anat}
Anatomical difficulty can be further divided into difficulty with:
* Mask Ventilation
* SAD placement
* Intubation
* FOI
* FONA

Difficulty with one technique is associated with difficulty of other techniques.
* Consider **elective cannulation of the CTM** if multiple anatomical difficulties exist


###Difficult Mask Ventilation
Defined as inability to keep ventilate without:
* 2-person technique
* Airway adjuncts
* Paralysis

Assessment:
* Typically poorly predicted  
In one study, only 17% of difficulty was predicted.
* Risk increases with >1 risk factor

Risk Factors (**MBBS MAT**):
* **M**allampati III/IV
* **B**eard
* **B**MI >25
* **S**noring
* **M**ale
* **A**ge >55
* **T**eeth (lack of)



###Difficult Intubation
Risk factors (**LEMON**):
* Cormack and **L**ehane Grading:  
Cook modification correlates better with time to intubate and requirement for adjuncts.  
![Cook Modification](/resources/c&lgradecookmod.png)
	* Grades are by best view, with or without ELM or BURP
	* This modification adds additional complexity  
	The author recommends subdividing into three tiers which have greater practical value:
		* Easy: Laryngeal inlet visible
		* Restricted: Posterior glottic structures visible  
		Likely amenable to bougie.
		* Difficult: Epiglottis cannot be lifted/No structures visible  
		Likely require specialist or blind techniques, and is associated with a significantly longer intubation time.
* **E**xternal anatomy  
The 3-3-2 rule is a crude predictor of difficult airway:
	* Interincisor distance <3cm
	* Thyromental distance <3cm
	* Hyoid-thyroid notch distance <1cm
* **M**allampati score  
MP 4 is associated with >10% change of difficult intubation.
* **O**bstruction
* **N**eck mobility  
Ability to assume the ear-to-sternal notch position.


###Difficult SAD Placement
Defined as inability to ventilate, requiring removal and tracheal intubation.

SAD failure occurs in ~1% of instances, and is usually due to:
* Leak
* Obstruction

Risk Factors (**PROMPT**):
* **P**oor respiratory compliance
* **R**estricted mouth opening
* **O**besity
* **M**ale
* **P**osition  
Non-level operating table.
* **T**eeth (poor)


###Difficult FOI

Epidemiology:
* FOI failure occurs in ~1.5% of instances. 
* Epistaxis occurs in ~10%
	* Severe epistaxis occurs in ~1.3%


###Difficult FONA
Risk factors (**SHORT**):
* **S**urgery 
* **H**aematoma
* **O**besity
* **R**adiation
* **T**umour


##Physiological Difficulty {#phys}	
Key physiological states that affect intubation are the **VAPOURS**:
* **Ventilation**  
PPV may have many detrimental effects:
	* Reduce VR and therefore BP
	* Volutrauma and barotrauma
	* Gastric insufflation
* **Acidaemia**  
Very high minute ventilation may be compensating for metabolic acidosis  
	* Rendering the patient apnoeic may lead to a rapid increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub>, fall in pH, and precipitate cardiac arrest
		* **Consider gentle BMV during the apnoeic period to reduce this risk**  
		This needs to be balanced against the risk of gastric insufflation and aspiration.
	* Use ETCO<sub>2</sub> during preoxygenation to identify what the patients (compensating) ETCO<sub>2</sub> is prior to induction
	* Aim for an ETCO<sub>2</sub> **at least as low** post-induction
* **Pressures**  
Important pressures to consider (**ABG**):
	* **Airway** pressures  
	Avoid excessive airway pressures (Aim Pplat <30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O):
		* Auto-PEEP  
		Increases RV afterload, reducing VR and subsequently BP.
			* **Beware hypoxia secondary to impaired circulation** due to this reason, and avoid increasing minute ventilation further  
			Ensure **adequate time for expiration**, especially in patients with obstructive lung disease.
		* Barotrauma
	* **Systemic arterial pressure**  
	Aim for a higher systemic BP prior to induction.
	* **Pulmonary arterial pressure**  
	PAP will also be affected by pH and PAO<sub>2</sub>. **Defend the systemic MAP** to maintain RV perfusion.
	* **Gastric** pressure
* **Oxygenation**  
Hypoxia is:
	* What kills patients during prolonged attempts at intubation
	* More important than ventilation, **except** at extremes of pH  
	A starting pH of 7.1 will lead to a pH of ~6.9 after 4 minutes of apnoea (assuming a normal VCO<sub>2</sub>).
	* Reduced by:
		* Adequate denitrogenation  
		Increase FRC oxygen concentration and therefore oxygen reserve.
		* Lung recruitment  
		Increase FRC volume.
* **Underlying disease**
* **Regurgitation**  
Consider the risks of aspiration and other airway contaminants (e.g. blood).
* **Shock Index**  
$$SI = {HR \over BP}$$. If the SI is >1, then consider initiating vasopressors/volume prior to intubation. If using vasopressor infusions, then prepare these prior.
	* Dose reduce sedatives  
	Up to **90%**.
	* Dose increase relaxants
	* Aggressively treat hypotension
