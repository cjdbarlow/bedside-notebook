#Major Incident Assessment and Medical Management

A major incident occurs when the location, number, severity, or type of live casualties requires **extraordinary resources**. Major incidents can be:
* Natural of man-made
* Simple or compound  
A compound incident occcurs when releveant infrastructure (roads, hospitals, and lines of communication) is also disrupted/destroyed.
* Compensated or uncompensated  
An uncompensated incident occurs when the casualties exceed the resources to treat them. An incident may:
	* Move from uncompensated to compensated as additional resources are mobilised
	* Be more likely to be uncompensated when:
		* Surge capacity planning has not occured
		* Resources are lacking  
		Remote regions are more likely to experience an uncompenated incident for any given casualty load.
		* Confounding factors

Casualty numbers:
* Major  
Incident handled by resources of individual hospitals.
* Mass  
Incident overwhelms response. May involve closure or evacuation of health facility, or persistent disruption over many days.
* Catastrophic  
Severe disruption to health and social care and other supportive infrastructure (e.g. water, electricity, transport).

##Preparation
Emergency preparation is vital to limiting extent and severity of an incident. Preparedness involves:
* Preparation
	* Planning
		* Should be **all-hazard**  
		Needs to be generic enough to cover all disasters.
		* Health service plans
			* Ambulance service plan
			* Internal hospital plans  
			Based on number and likely type of casualties for the incident.
		* High-risk venue plans  
		e.g. Stadiums, festivals, protests are all high-risk settings.
		* Government plans  
		Regional/State/National plans for coordinating resources.
		* Creating surge capacity
			* Inter- and intra-agency written protocols
			* Succession planning within organisations
			* Backup radio and communication networks
			* Equipment stockpiles
			* Sources of transport  
			Agreements to obtain commercial or military vehicles.
	* Equipment
		* PPE
		* Tools and extraction equipment
		* Medical equipment  
		Appropriate to level of skill and training of providers.
	* Training
		* Education  
		Should precede exercise, so the maximum value of the exercise is realised.
		* Exercises  
			* May involve:
				* Table-top exercises
				* Triage exercises with simulated casualties
				* Communication exercises
				* Practical exercises without casualties
				* Virtual responses
				* Multi-agency exercises
			* Include:
				* Level A  
				Major live multi-agency exercise.
				* Level B  
				Major table-top multi-agency exercise.
				* Level C  
				Local level exercise examining a specific issue.
* Response
* Recovery


##Overview of Incident Response
Response **from all services** involves **CSCATT**:
* Command and Control
	* Scene layout
* Safety  
Of:
	* Self
	* Scene
	* Survivors
* Communications  
Particularly the **ETHANE** approach.
* Assessment
	* Hazards
	* CCS
* Triage
* Treatment
* Transport


Priorities are to:
* Save life
* Prevent escalation
* Relieve suffering
* Protect property
* Launch inquiries


Medical response is led by the:
* Ambulance Commander
* Medical Commander

###Command and Control
>Organisations are commanded, situations are controlled, and resources are coordinated

* Command  
Held by each emergency service at scene.
	* Runs vertically in each service
* Control  
Held by **one** service at scene.
	* Runs horizontally **across the services**  
	* In Australia, service in control will depend on the nature of the incident  
	Ambulance and medical are never a control agency.


Tiers of Command:
* Strategic/Gold Command
	* Usually only one Gold Command
	* Cross state/national boundaries may require multi-agency gold command  
	Regional or national ocoordination may be established above this; known as platinum command.
	* Supports tactical command
	* Generally not on site
		* Regional emergency operation centre
* Tactical/Silver Command  
	* Commanders of each service  
	Co-location of service commanders forms Joint Services Emergency Control.
	* Located inside the outer cordon
	* Allocate resouces to operaetional commanders
	* Interservice operational requests are requested at the silver command level
* Operational/Bronze Command
	* Multiple bronze commanders dealing with particular sectors
	* Oversee operational activities  
	Commanders **do not become involved in casualty treatment**.

####Layout
Scene layout:
* Outer cordon  
Prevents access by general public. Usually established and maintained by police.
* Inner cordon  
Area around scene, outside of which service facilities are established. Usually established by fire.

Health service response requires:
* Ambulance Command Point  
Ambulance command vehicle.
	* May be co-located with other service command vehicles to form the Joint Services Emergency Control (JSEC)
	* Reporting point for all health personnel
* Ambulance Parking Point  
Holding bay for ambulances when not on tasking.
* Forward Control Point  
Area close to the incident, where the forward commander can direct operations. May be multiple forward control points, with multiple forward commanders.
* Ambulance Loading Point  
Area where ambulances collect casualties from CCS.
* Casualty Clearing Station  
Point of secondary triage and casualty treatment. Should be:
	* Safe
	* Accessible:
		* From the scene  
		As close as possible without compromising safety.
		* To evacuation routes
	* Sheltered
	* Well-lit
	* Of appropriate size
	* Laid out as follows:
		* Equipment in one section
		* One entry for patients from the scene
		* One exit for patients to Ambulance Loading Point
		* Patients with heads easily accessible  
			* Semi-circle around team leader/provider
			* Feet against the wall
		* Sections for casualties of each priority

###Safety
Code of safety is the '1-2-3' of safety:
1. Self
	* Adequate PPE
	* Personal identification
	* Communication tools
	* Torch
2. Scene
3. Survivors  
Prevent further casualties.
	* Evacuate uninjured survivors


Risk Asseessment:
* Look for hazards
* Decide:
	* Who is at risk
	* How they are at risk
* Evaluate degree of risk
* Determine how to remove or minimise risk


Safe approaches:
* Approach upwind  
Minimise exposure to contamination.
* Report to rendevous point  
Ensures reporting and appropriate deployment.
* Check in with emergency vehicles close to scene  
May be standing off.
* Aim to stay at least 100m away from incident  
Minimise risk of injury from secondary blast.
* Retreat if continuous loud noises  
May indicate leak present.
* Wear maximal PPE

###Communication
> Poor communication is the commonest failing at the scene of a major incident

Failures of communication occur when there is a lack of:
* Information
* Confirmation
* Coordination

Key messages:
* Major incident - standby  
Alerts hospital that a major incident is possible.
* Major incident declared  
Incident has occured and the response is enacted.
* Major incident - cancelled  
Above order rescinded.

####Methods
* Radio net
* Landlines
* Mobile networks  
Reception often poor when net is saturated.
* Runners  
With handwritten messages.


####Radio Procedure
Radio traffic should be:
* Rhythm  
Steady rhythm.
* Speed  
Slower than normal.
* Volume  
Of adequate volume.
* Pitch  
Higher pitch is more readable.

Common radio pro-words:
* I SPELL  
Next word spelled phonetically.
* SAY AGAIN  
Request to repeat all of the last transmission.
	* SAY AGAIN ALL AFTER  
	Repeat message after a given phrase.
	* SAY AGAIN ALL BEFORE  
	Repeat message before a given phrase.
* OVER  
I have finished talking.
* OUT  
The conversation is finished. Only to be stated by the party initiating the call.
* WAIT 1/2/3/4/5  
Wait a given number of seconds.
* WAIT OUT  
Wait longer than 5 seconds; conversation is over in interim.
* RADIO CHECK  
Check of **strength and readability** of radio signal with another call-sign.
	* Strength  
	Can be:
		* Loud
		* Good
		* Weak
		* Very weak
		* Fading
	* Readability  
	Can be:
		* Clear
		* Readable
		* Distorted
		* Unreadable
		* With interference
* FIGURES  
When giving a number; e.g. "sixty, figures six-zero".
* MESSAGE/PREPARE TO COPY  
I have to tell you something.
* SEND  
I am ready to receive your message.



###Scene Assessment  
Initial assessment:
* Should be rapid
* Determines speed and adequacy of initial response
* Performed using **METHANE**:
	* **M**ajor Incident  
	Advise standby or declared.
	* **E**xact Location  
	Accurate as possible: grid reference, site, landmarks.
	* **T**ype of Incident  
	e.g. Road traffic, chemical, rail.
	* **H**azards  
	Actual and potential.
	* **A**ccess/Egress  
	Safe direction for approaches and departures.
	* **N**umber of casualties  
	May include severity and type.
	* **E**mergency services  
	Present and/or required.


Ongoing assessment can be covered with **HANE**.


###Triage{#triage}
*Covered in detail under [triage](/assessment/env/triage.md).*

Triage is:
* The cornerstone of support
* Involves sorting casulaties into treatment priorities
* Requires an appropriate labelling system
	* Easily and securely attached
	* Marked and colour coded
	* Durable and weather resistant
	* Able to be written on
	* Facilitate rapid and clear re-categorisation


###Treatment{#treatment}	
Aims to do the most for the most; i.e. maximise utilitarian benefit. May include:
* First aid  
Should allow immediate intervention in life-threatening conditions.
	* May include devices to support respiration  
	This consumes significant resources and may not be appropriate depending on the number and severity of casulaties relative to the number and expertise of providers.
* Advanced Life Support  
	* Provided at CCS
	* Extent of resuscitation attempts will depend on casualty load
* Blood product  
	* Exceptional circumstances only
	* Usually coordinated through local services
	* Regular donor centres are usually used to facilitate donation
* Specialist medical intervention  
Supplied and supported by medical teams.


###Transport
In general:
* Most casualties will be moved to hospital, either by own means or by emergency services
	* Prior 3s should be evacuated by non-medical transport *en masse* to a receiving hospital  
	Can be placed on buses/civilian transports.
* Transport mode based upon:
	* Capacity
	* Availability
	* Suitability
* Evacuation order may not strictly be based upon priority  
Considerations:
	* Current transport modes available
	* How stable a given patient is for transfer  
	Benefit of additional care that can be provided at CCS>
	* Disease process  
	e.g. Airway burns.
	* Definitive care required
	* Revised trauma score value  
	Can be used to subdivide within priority categories.
