##ANZCA Final Exam
The ANZCA final exam consists of a:
* Written examination
	* MCQs
	* SAQs
* Medical Viva
* Anaesthetic Viva



###Short Answer Questions
As with the primary examination, a structured answer format:
* Increases the chance you will deliver a complete answer
* Decreases stress
* Is less painful to listen to


Almost all questions can fit into one of **five structures**:
* The **Emergency**  
A crisis of some kind.
	* "This is an emergency"
	* Immediate actions
	* Send for help
	* Simultaneous diagnosis and treatment
	* An ABC approach
* **Anaesthetic plan for *a* patient**
	* Pre-op and induction
	* Intra-op and maintenance
	* Post-op and emergence
* **Anaesthetic plan for *this* patient**  
Pre-operative management, use:
	* History
	* Examination
	* Investigations
	* Referral
* **Issues for *this* patient**  
This is the Cluedo patient: The appendix, with the Fontan, in the regional centre.
	* Patient factors
	* Anaesthetic factors
	* Surgical factors
* **Assessment and management of a disease process**  
Use a system based answer:
	* Airway considerations
	* Respiratory considerations
	* Etc
* **Welfare question**  
When answer a welfare question for the ANZCA Part II Exam; aim:
	* Protect the patient
	* Protect the doctor
	* Short-term measures
	* Long-term measures



###Medical Viva
Structure:
* 12% of marks
* Two 20 minute vivas
	* 2 minutes reading time
		* Stem
		* Medication list  
		Provided on door and in the room of the *viva voce*.
	* 9 minutes history and examination  
		* There will be a timer in the room
		* Warning when 7 of the 9 minutes has elapsed
	* 9 minutes *viva voce*  
	Synthesise and present findings.
* Is **not** a preanaesthetic anaesthetic
* Focuses on understanding of medical disease  
Particularly assessing **severity** and **stability** of disease.  
* Only point in examination process where interaction with a patient is demonstrated


Fundamentals:
* Time management  
4.5 minutes for history, 4.5 minutes for examination.
* Assess severity and stability
	* Functional impact
* Systematic and **relevant** examination


Tips:
* Practice the timing as much as possible
* Equipment
	* Stethoscope
	* Clipboard  
	If you like.
* History
	* Have a nice way to interrupt the patient  
	"I have a limited time today, so I may interrupt you."
	* Ask the patient their diagnosis
	* Be kind
* Examination
	* Wash your hands  
	You won't fail if you don't.
	* Don't hurt the patient
	* Position the patient how you wish
	* Breast exposure can be fraught  
	Comment that you would normally examine the whole chest, and ask the patient if they can lower the gown to above the nipple line - let the patient make the decision.
	* If the patient has been diagnosed with a murmur but you cannot hear one, consider a diastolic murmur
* Practice interpreting common investigations
	* ECG
	* CXR
	* ABG
	* PFTs
	* TTE  
	Read the summary initially, and then the raw values if these don't answer your question.

Pitfalls:
* History:
	* Not systematic
	* Not listening to the patient
	* Failure to assess severity and stability
	* Failure to assess function
* Examination:
	* Incorrect position or posture
	* Failure to expose the patient
	* Failure to ask observations
	* Not systematic
	* *In*appropriately detailed  
	e.g. Spending evaluating for peripheral stigmata of endocarditis, without history pointing towards this.
* Summary/presentation
	* Not concise
	* Does not address severity and stability
	* Poor selection of investigations  
	Asking for 'routine' investigations, rather than targeted and high-yield investigations.
	* Poor interpretation of investigations
	* Poor integration of investigations to history and examination


###Anaesthetic Viva
Process:
* A 'realistic' patient scenario which evolves overtime
* Tests the candidate at multiple points with dilemmas and disasters
* Examines depth, breadth, and integration of knowledge
* Aims to **assess judgment** and **decision making**
* A professional discussion with a colleague
* Tests if you are **ready** to **be a consultant**  
Evaluates your:
	* Knowledge
	* Safety
	* Leadership
	* Patient advocacy
	* Collaborative approach
	* Professional


Structure:
* Eight 15 minute vivas
	* 2 minutes reading time  
	Immerse yourself in the stem:
		* Your role  
		Not always the anaesthetist.
		* Your location  
		Resources.
		* Your patient  
		Equipment sizes, drug dosing.
		* Your resources
	* Bells indicate start and end of viva
	* One examiner, often an observer
* Required to pass viva to pass exam
* Similar layout to primary exam


Dilemmas and Decisions:
* Tricky situations
* Not all unstable clinical situations requires the emergency buzzer  
But press it when you need to.
	* Failure to act safely is viewed very poorly
* Patients will deteriorate irrespective of how you are performing


Tips:
* Think like a consultant
* Have confidence or fake confidence
* Enter a dialogue with the examiner - they are a colleague, not a boss
* Immerse yourself in the scenario
* Take some time to think of an answer  
Not too much.
* Can discuss balance of risks without waffling
* Be authentic
* If you are unsure of a course of action, then describe your rationale
* Have some handy phrases
	* "In addition to my usual anaesthetic assessment..."
* Know what to say if you don't know what to do


Pitfalls:
* Attitude
	* Non-consultant like
	* Indecisive  
	Using 'could' not 'would.'
	* Inflexible
		* Refusing to bed led
	* Waffling
	* Too many lists
	* Does not answer question
* Knowledge
	* Insufficient
	* Long checklists do not demonstrate understanding
	* Inaccurate
	* Not recognising knowledge gaps  
	Demonstrates lack of safety.
* Safety
	* Inappropriate drug doses
	* Does not know how to manage a crisis
	* Lacks insight
	* Refuses to accept guidance
