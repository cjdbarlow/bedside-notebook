#Principles of Neuroanaesthesia

Key principles:
* Preoperative assessment
	* Presentation
		* Neurological findings  
		**Pre-operative deficits**.
		* Conscious state
	* Treatment
		* Steroids
			* Diabetes
			* Neutrophilia
		* Anticonvulsants
* Optimal operating conditions
	* Relaxed brain  
		* Reduce global ICP
		* Reduce retraction pressure  
		May reduce CVA risk under retractor.
	* Haemodynamic stability
* Cerebral protection
	* Maintain DO<sub>2</sub>
	* Ischaemic protection
* Emergence
	* Haemodynamic stability
	* Rapid and predictable return of consciousness

##Anaesthesia Considerations
* A
	* Remote airway and inaccessible
	* Avoidance of coughing
		* Remifentanil extubation
		* Laryngeal mask exchange
* B
	* CO<sub>2</sub> control
* C
	* Haemodynamic stability  
	Most cases require precise haemodynamic control.
* D
	* Anaesthetic choice
		* Volatile impairs cerebral autoregulation in:
			* Increasing concentrations  
			**Always** some vasodilation, but the effect is **dose-dependent**. Often ⩽1 MAC is acceptable.
				* Sevoflurane has the least effect on cerebral blood flow, and is the most suitable volatile agent  
				Isoflurane and desflurane significantly worse.
			* Presence of hypercarbia  
			Loss of CO<sub>2</sub> reactivity is a bad sign.
		* Nitrous oxide has several detrimental effects due to cerebral vasodilation
		* Propofol reduces ICP and increases CPP to a greater extent than sevoflurane  
		**TIVA** desirable in any patient with severely **raised ICP**
	* Rapid emergence improves neurological assessment and early detection of complications
