*This covers factors unique to clipping of intracranial aneurysms. Factors relating to craniotomies in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/neuro/craniotomy.md).*


Clipping of an intracranial aneurysm involves placing a spring clip across the aneurysmal neck to occlude it. Clipping is performed under GA. Approaches include:
* TIVA  
May be preferred in cases with high ICP, using propofol and remifentanil.
* Volatile  
Sub-MAC with a remifentanil infusion.


##Considerations
* B
	* **No coughing or movement is tolerated**  
	Dissection of vasculature and aneurysm are delicate.
		* Deep opioid analgesia with remifentanil
		* Deep muscle relaxation (TOF of 0)
* C
	* Stable haemodynamics  
	Avoid alterations in aneurysm transmural pressure critical to prevent re-bleeding.
		* Usually target 140-160mmHg; discuss with surgeon
		* Hypo- and hypertension can be disastrous
	* Consider two IV access sites:  
		* One large volume line
		* One anaesthetic/remifentanil infusion line
	* Arterial line
	* Have a plan for:
		* Aneurysmal rupture
		* Management of temporary clipping
* D
	* ICP control
		* Optimise CO<sub>2</sub>
		* Head up
		* Sodium
		* Vent EVD if in situ and appropriate
	* Cerebroprotective strategies may be required if a temporary clip is placed over a major vessel  
	Increase BP gently to at least that of pre-operative BP.
	* Vasospasm prophylaxis
	* Avoid N<sub>2</sub>O

* E
	* Muscle relaxation  
	Not *technically* required if using remifentanil, but paralysis recommended given the extreme requirement for immobility.
		* Aim ToF = 0
		* Consider relaxant infusion  
		Cisatracurium reliable and will wear off adequately for extubation if ceased when skull replaced.

##Preparation
* Standard monitoring
* Awake arterial line
* Large venous access
* Consider CVC  
For aspiration of gas in case of air embolism in patients in seated position.


##Induction
* Haemodynamic stability is vital  
Avoid ⩽ 10% change in SBP.
	* Propofol and remifentanil standard in most institutions


##Intraoperative
Aneurysmal Rupture:
* Call for help
* Reduce bleeding
	* Requires urgent surgical control of source
	* **Reverse heparin** if in IR
	* Induce hypotension to reduce haemorrhage  
		* Target:
			* SBP <100mmHg if in IR
			* Reduction of haemorrhage if in OT
		* Strategies  
		Multiple options; will depend on severity of haemorrhage and what is currently running/drawn up/available. Some include:
			* Anaesthetic agents
				* Propofol  
				Immediately available and intimately familiar, but may not be enough.
				* Remifentanil bolus (e.g. 1ug/kg)  
				* Thiopentone  
			* Cardiac agents
				* Adenosine
				* Labetalol
				* Esmolol
				* GTN  
				3-5mg/kg bolus, then 3-5mg/kg/hr, targeted to burst suppression.
	* Compress ipsilateral carotid artery to reduce bleeding
* Volume resuscitation
	* Increase IVT rate
	* Begin transfusion
* Consider cerebroprotective strategies


Induced Hypotension:  
* May be requested to reduce risk of aneurysmal bleeding  
* Aim SBP 60-80mmHg
Consider:  
	* 5-10mg labetalol boluses
	* Increase anaesthetic depth


Cerebroprotection:
* May be requested if placing temporary clip on a major vessel
* Goal is to maintain cerebral perfusion by collateral vessels
* Gentle elevation in BP desirable


###Surgical Stages
* Craniotomy
* Dissection and exposure of aneurysm
Delicate - **ensure immobility**.
* Potential temporary clipping of vessels supplying aneurysm  
* Clipping of aneurysm  
Multiple clips may be applied.
* Potential aspiration of aneurysm  
To ensure that there is no further flow to the lesion.



##Postoperative
May require ICU care if:
* Complicated intraoperative course
* Vasospasm
* Poor grade SAH prior
