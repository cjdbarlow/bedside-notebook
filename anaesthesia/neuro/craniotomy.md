##Techniques
Under GA:
* Volatile
	* Avoid N<sub>2</sub>O
	* Use < 1 MAC
* TIVA  
May be preferred in cases with high ICP. One approach:
	* TCI propofol at 3-6ug/mL
	* Remifentanil 0.1-0.3ug/kg/min  
	Reduces need for top-up muscle relaxation.

##Considerations
* A
	* Airway is not accessible intraoperatively, intubate and secure well
	* Use a reinforced tube
* B
	* Coughing is not allowed  
	Ensure adequate muscle relaxation (test regularly, consider use of muscle relaxant infusion) or use deep opioid anaesthesia (e.g. remifentanil infusion not less than 0.2ug/kg/min).
	* Ventilate to normal PaCO<sub>2</sub> in most instances  
	Avoid cerebral ischaemia.
* C
	* Aim normotension during most procedures  
* E
	* Aim normothermia  
	36°C-37°C.


##Preparation
* Standard monitoring
* Arterial line  
* Core temperature monitoring
* CVC
	* Administration of vasoactives
	* Aspiration of air in case of venous air embolism


##Induction
Haemodynamic stability is important:
* Remifentanil infusion usually adequate  
	* Begin at 0.2-0.3ug/kg/min, and titrate to effect  
	Can be bolused, but this increases risk of bradycardia and CVS instability.
	* Once adequately loaded (~1ug/kg), can then commence induction with propofol
* Otherwise fentanyl (5ug/kg) or alfentanil (25-50ug/kg/hr)


##Intraoperative
* Anaesthesia can be maintained with either sub-MAC dose of volatile or propofol TIVA
* Remifentanil allows for substantial reduction in anaesthetic requirement

###Surgical Stages
Beware stimulating parts of this procedure and aim to maintain haemodynamic stability throughout:
* Intubation
* Application of clamps:
	* Associated with significant hypertension
	* Cover with bolus of 0.5-1ug/kg remifentanil or 0.5-1mg/kg propofol
* Local anaesthetic with adrenaline  
Intravascular adrenaline will also cause CVS compromise.
* Skin and skull incision
* Once dura is opened, surgical stimulation drops markedly

Closure of dura:
* Typically indicates ~30-45 minutes of operating time remaining
* Administer a long-acting opioid when remifentanil infusion is ceased


##Postoperative
* May require additional IV opioid recovery  
Monitor carefully for decreased GCS as this may be either anaesthetic or surgically related.
