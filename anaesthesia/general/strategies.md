#Anaesthetic Strategies

Brief descriptions of anaesthetic strategies for:
* Intubation/induction
* Maintenance
* Emergence


##Intubation/Induction
Post-induction checklist:
* Airway
	* Intact
* Breathing
	* What are they breathing?  
	Gases, FiO<sub>2</sub>.
	* How are they breathing?  
	Mode, pressure values.
	* Is it adequate?
* Circulation
	* Rate/rhythm
	* Pressures
* Drugs
	* Anaesthesia
	* Analgesics
	* Antibiotics
	* Antiemetics
	* Muscle relaxation
* Environment
	* Positioning
	* Eyes
	* Warming
* Fluids and electrolytes
	* Plan for IVT
	* Urine output
	* BSL
* G
	* NGT


###Awake Intubation Strategies
Using Propofol & Remifentanil:
* Goal is to keep spontaneous ventilation occurring throughout
* Begin and maintain remifentanil at 0.01μg/kg/min
* Commence propofol TCI at Cp of 1μg/ml
* When the propofol Ce reaches 0.5μg/ml, increase the Cp slowly
* Goal is to have $$Ce - Cp \approx 0.5$$  
This should ensure spontaneous ventilation maintained, though it takes quite some time to achieve.
* Generally:
	* Laryngoscopy is tolerated at Cp of 4μg/ml
	* Intubation is tolerated at Cp of 6μg/ml


###Relaxant-free Intubation
Using remifentanil:
* 3-5μg/kg, up to ~250μg
* Wait for the bradycardia  
* Beware wooden chest
* Will provide typically 3-4 minutes of apnoea


Using fentanyl:
* 5-7μg/kg
* Standard dose of propofol
* Time intubation with peak propofol effect


###Synergistic Drug Combinations
Diluted propofol:
* Reduces pain on injection
* Useful in paediatrics
* Method:
	* 1mg/kg of lignocaine and 2mg/kg of propofol
	* Dilute mixture to 25ml total volume with normal saline
	* Give via slow push

	
##Gas Induction
Gentle gas induction to minimise smell of sevoflurane:
* 50-70% FiN<sub>2</sub>O
* Start sevoflurane at 0.5%
* Double sevoflurane concentration every:
	* 4-5 breaths
	* Or when end-tital sevoflurane concentration is ~0.5 of inspired sevoflurane concentration


##Maintenance
###Spontaneously Ventilating GA
Propofol/Alfentanil TIVA:
* Use a propofol TCI model (e.g. marsh model)
* Add alfentanil to propofol syringe
	* Add 1mg to first and second 50ml syringe
	* Add 0.5mg to subsequent syringes  
	Up to ~5-6 syringes worth.
* Titrate additional opioid (oxycodone, fentanyl) to respiratory rate



##Emergence
From volatile and remifentanil:
* Begin volatile wash out during wound closure
* Trace volatile and remifentanil will keep patients functionally anaesthetised in absence of surgical stimulation
* Turn off remifentanil prior to transferring patient from the operating table
* Extubate on bed

##Deep Extubation
Requires:
* Steady, stable, adequate ventilation on minimal pressure suppport
* No response (cough, breath-hold, or altered respiratory pattern) to:
	* Removal of ETT tape/tie
	* Suctioning of oropharynx
	* Deflation of ETT cuff
* Removal of tube at end-inspiration  
Vocal cords maximally abducted.


##Regional Strategies

###Short-Acting Neuraxial
> Ideal for day cases where avoidance of GA is ideal


Perform a CSE with:
* Spinal  
1ml 0.5% heavy bupivacaine and 20μg fentanyl.
* Top up with 5ml 2% lignocaine to desired block height
