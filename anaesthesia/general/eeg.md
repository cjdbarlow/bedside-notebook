#Processed EEG Interpretation

Processed EEG monitors are:
* Commonly used in general anaesthesia  
Particularly TIVA.
* May reduce incidence of anaesthetic awareness  
Particularly in high-risk patients.
* Provide both a:
	* Set of numbers crudely indicating anaesthetic depth
	* Raw EEG waveform
* A poor predictor of responsiveness to nociceptive stimulation

**Like any monitor**, outputs may be **misleading**:
* Artifacts are common  
May be:
	* Extracranial
		* Electrical equipment
		* Pacemakers
		* EEG
		* Movement
	* Extra-cerebral
		* Muscular activity
	* Pathologic cranial activity
		* Seizures
		* Normal low-amplitude EEG  
		Present in 5-10% of the population.
* Need to be interpreted in the broader clinical context


##Principles
* Frontal cortical activity is increased by anaesthetic agents  
Forehead allows this to be measured.
* Electrodes detect potential difference from multiple current sources
	* Frontalis
	* Extrocular muscles
	* Heart


##Common EEG Patterns
> * EEG has no fixed repeating pattern, and will change randomly over time
> * In steady levels of anaesthesia or wakefulness, it will have some constant statistical features


Awake:
* Small amplitude, high frequency
* "Fuzzy"
* Blinks and eye movements
* May be high amplitude and high frequency EMG activity
* Alpha oscillations if relaxed and eyes closed



Drowsy:
* Loss of EMG, eye movements, and blinks
* Increasing amplitude


Light anaesthesia:
* Bigger, slower waves that wax and wane
* Sleep spindles
* Slow delta waves


Deep anaesthesia:
* Longer lasting, slower spindles
* Burst suppression
* Isoelectricity


##Drug Effects on the EEG
Effect of anaesthetic adjuncts:
* Ketamine
	* Increases high frequency EEG activity  
	Increases BIS and M-entropy values.
* Nitrous oxide  
Generally minimal effect:
	* Unconsciousness occurring predominantly from nitrous oxide results in a high BIS value
	* Addition of nitrous oxide results in minimal EEG change
	* Has been associated with a **paradoxical decrease** in BIS values 5-10 minutes **after discontinuation**
* Opioids  
Variable effect:
	* Small doses typically minimal effect
	* Larger doses may produce slowing
	* Do reduce dose requirement of GABAergic agents
* α2-agonists  
Similar to GABAergic drugs.
