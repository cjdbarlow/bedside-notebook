#Cell Salvage

Cell salvage involves:
* Collecting blood from the surgical field  
Low-pressure to avoid haemolysis. **Citrate is added immediately** to prevent coagulation.
	* Continuous
	* Intermittent
* Washing and filtering blood  
Removal of contaminants.
* Separation  
Centrifuge of red cells.
* Reinfusion  
Salvaged, citrated blood is collected in a bag, stored at room temperatures, and must be reinfused within 4 hours.


##Indications
Relative indications:
* Significant blood loss
	* Cardiac surgery
	* Vascular surgery
* Rare blood groups/auto-antibodies
* Religious groups with objections to transfusion  
May not be acceptable to all.
* Reduced blood bank access


##Advantages
* Reduces transfusion by up to 40%
	* Cost
	* Transfusion reactions
* Higher 2,3-DPG than allogenic blood


##Disadvantages
* Cost
	* Initial cost is expensive, value will depend on use frequency
* Haemolysis
* Absence of coagulation factors  
May lead to dilutional coagulopathy.
* Embolism
	* Air
	* Fat
	* Microaggregates
* Salvaged blood syndrome  
* Citrate load  
Calcium required to reverse.
* TACO
* Hypotension  
Due to bradykinin from leukodepletion filters.


###Special Circumstances
Controversy remains around:
* Malignancy  
Concern about reinfusion of tumour cells, but no evidence of this.
* Contamination  
Potential for bacteraemia if salvage from contaminated site; use is not recommended.
* Obstetrics  
Risk of:
	* AFE  
	No evidence, but double suction used with the non-amniotic suction used to remove amnion.
	* Rhesus sensitisation  
	From foetal blood; mitigate with giving mother anti-D.
