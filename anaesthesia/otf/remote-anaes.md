#Principles of Off-the-Floor Anaesthesia

Provision of anaesthesia outside of the operating theatre or ICU typically means reduced access to resucitation staff and equipment. These locations include:
* Radiology
	* MRI
* Cardiac catheter laboratories
* Psychiatry
* Dentistry
* Burns dressings


##Considerations
* A
	* Airway equipment
	* Suction
* B
	* Primary and backup oxygen sources
	* Presence of bag-mask system
* C
	* Resuscitation drugs
	* Availability of defibrillation and pacing
* D
	* Anaesthetic drug availability
		* Scavenging for volatile agents
* Adequate equipment:
	* Availability of invasive and non-invasive monitoring
	* Power supply
	* Battery backups
	* Space
	* Lighting
* Adequate staffing
	* Resucitation trained staff
