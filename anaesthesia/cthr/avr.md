#Aortic Valve Repair/Replacement
>Airway: ETT <br>
>Access: 14G IVC or MAC line, arterial line, CVC, +/- PAC <br>
>Pain: Substantial, especially in younger patients<br>
>Position: Supine/crucifix <br>
>Time: 3-4 hours  <br>
>Blood loss: G+H required. Cross-match if **re-do surgery**, anaemic, small, sick, or emergency. <br>
>Special: CPB - higher risk for anaesthetic awareness  

Intervention on the aortic valve is performed for:
* Stenosis  
Not amenable to repair.
* Regurgitation
* Stenosis/Regurgitation
* Endocarditis

Surgical techniques include:
* Replacement  
Typical, and may be performed with:
	* Bioprosthetic valves
		* Porcine or bovine
		* Do not require anticoagulation
		* Do not last as long as mechanical valves
	* Mechanical valves
		* Require anticoagulation
		* Last longer than bioprosthetic valves
	* Homografts  
	Rarely available.
* Repair  
Appropriate for isolated regurgitation, with or without associated aneurysm. Technique will depend on:
	* Cause of regurgitation  
	Defect of the the:
		* STJ  
		Supracoronary replacement of ascending aorta with prosthesis.
		* Annulus  
		Multiple techniques:
			* Annuloplasty ring  
			May be:
				* Extraaortic
				* Intraaortic
			* Plegeted sutures  
			Rarely permits complete stability of annulus.
		* Leaflets  
		Amenability to repair depends on valve morphology; particularly the ability to achieve an effective relationship between the:
			* Effective height  
			Height from annulus to leaflet tip.
			* Geometric height  
			Length of the valve leaflet.
			* Coaptation height  
			Height of leaflet contact during diastole.


##Considerations
*This covers factors unique to AVR. Factors relating to cardiac surgery in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/cthr/cthr-principles.md#id).*

* B
	* Left heart failure
* C
	* LVH  
		* Often occurs secondary to AS
		* Increases importance of good myocardial protection on CPB



##Preparation
*This covers factors unique to AVR. Factors relating to cardiac surgery in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/cthr/cthr-principles.md#id).*

##Induction
* Haemodynamically stable induction is vital
	* Consider vasopressor infusion in critical AS.
	* Filling is important in AS and beneficial in AR

##Intraoperative
###Surgical Stages
* Median sternotomy
* Bicaval and aortic cannulation
* Establishement of CPB
* LV drained via PA
* Cardioplegia administered
* Aorta opened and existing valve excised and annulus debrided
* Annulus measured and valvular prostehesis sutured in place  
Rewarming during final stages of valvular implantation.
* Filing of the LV during aortic closure
* Left heart de-aired in the **head down** position
* Decannulation and reversal of heparinisation

##Postoperative
