#Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting

>Airway: ETT <br>
>Access: 14G IVC or MAC line, arterial line, CVC, +/- PAC <br>
>Pain: Substantial, especially in younger patients<br>
>Position: Supine/crucifix <br>
>Time: 3-4 hours  <br>
>Blood loss: G+H required. Cross-match if **re-do surgery**, anaemic, small, sick, or emergency. <br>
>Special: CPB - higher risk for anaesthetic awareness  

Use of an autologous artery or vein to bypass a stenosed section of coronary artery and restore downstream perfusion. CABGs:
* Are almost always performed under relaxant general anaesthesia.
* Can be performed 'on-pump' (with CPB) or 'off-pump'

##Considerations
* B
	* Atelectasis
	* Bronchospasm
* C
	* Severe LV or RV dysfunction
		* Pulmonary oedema
		* May be unable to wean from bypass
* H
	* Massive haemorrhage


##Preoperative Assessment
*This covers factors unique to CABG. Factors relating to cardiac surgery in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/cthr/cthr-principles.md#id).*

Evaluation should consider:
* CAD  
High risk features:
	* History:
		* Unstable angina
		* AMI within last 3 months
		* Cardiogenic shock
		* Emergency revascularisation.
		* Decompensated CCF
		* LV aneurysm  
		Indicates poor myocardial function.
	* Coronary anatomy:
		* **Left main disease**  
		Avoid drop in perfusion pressure in the case of critical left main stenosis.
			* Significant >50%
			* Severe >80%
			* Critical ~>95%
			* Note also that high-grade stenosis of the LAD and LCx lead to an effective critical stenosis of the LMCA
			* Note that effective stenosis depends on degree of collateralisation   
			Well-developed collaterals compensate for poor native disease.
		* Triple vessel disease
		* Proximal LAD stenosis
	* Ventricular function:
		* LVEF < 30%
		* Concominant RV dysfunction
* Valvular disease  
Particularly AS or MR.

##Preparation
As for [other cardiac surgery](/anaesthesia/cthr/cthr-principles.md#prep).

##Induction
* Aim for haemodynamic stability, especially in the setting of critical left main stenosis

###Intraoperative
*This covers factors unique to CABG. Factors relating to bypass are covered [here](/anaesthesia/cthr/cpb.md#id).*

On-pump CABG can be divided into pre-, intra-, and post-bypass phases:
* Pre-bypass
	* If LIMA harvest is occurring:
		* Decrease V<sub>T</sub> to 5-6ml/kg
		* Reduce anaesthetic  
		Period of minimal stimulation following the very stimulating sternotomy.
		* Increase FiO<sub>2</sub> as there is a frequent surgical requirement for apnoea
* Bypass
* Post-bypass


###Surgical Stages
For standard approach:
* Sternotomy
* Establish CPB
* Establish diastolic arrest
* Grafting performed
	* Internal mammary grafting
		* A pedicled graft may be taken  
		The origin is left attached to the SCA.
		* Bilateral IMA grafts may be used  
		Increases the risk of sternal wound infection due to poor perfusion.
	* Saphenous vein graft  
	~50% of SVG grafts will be occluded at 10 years (compared to ~10% of arterial grafts).
	* Radial artery  
	Non-dominant or dominant vessels may be used, provided there is adequate collateral flow via the ulnar artery.
* Cross-clamp is removed and coronary perfusion commences
* Wean from CPB occurs once air is removed from circulation


###Postoperative Care
* Transfer intubated to PACU/ICU
