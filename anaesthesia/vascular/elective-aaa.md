#Elective Open Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair
>Airway: ETT <br>
>Access: 14G IVC (two) or RIC line, CVC, arterial line. <br>
>Pain: Substantial, often in comorbid indivduals. Strongly consider thoracic epidural. <br>
>Position: Supine, arms out. <br>
>Time: 2-4 hours. <br>
>Blood loss: Extensive, with possibility of exsanguination. Cell saver, cross-match at least 4 units.  <br>
>Special: HDU/ICU required post-op.

Removal of an aneurysmal aorta and replacment with a synthetic graft. May be:
* Infra-renal
* Supra-renal  
Requires a supra-renal cross-clamp, and therefore is associated with significantly greater peri-operative AKI.


High risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality.	Discuss:
* 1-6% perioperative mortality
* Requirement for ventilation post-operatively
* Post-operative respiratory compromise
* Bleeding and transfusion requirement)


##Considerations
* B
	* Respiratory reserve
* C
	* Co-existing CVS disease
		* 40% of patients will have coexisting disease
		* Particularly cardiac function and presence of inducible ischaemia
	* Invasive monitoring
		* Arterial line pre-induction
		* CVC can be placed post-induction
		* Consider PAC in complex disease
	* Prepare for surgical manouveres that will affect BP
	Vasoactives:
		* Vasodilators  
		For the cross-clamp phase.
		* Vasopressors  
		For the ischaemic wash-out phase.
		* Inotropes
* D
	* Analgesic plan  
	Consider thoracic epidural.
* E
	* Warming devices
		* Upper body warmer  
		**Do not warm legs during cross clamp** - there is a risk of worsening ischaemia, as well as causing burns due to absence of circulation.
		* Fluid warmer
* F
	* Pre-existing renal impairment  
	Especially in supra-renal AAA.
* H
	* Rapid transfusion set available


##Preparation
* Standard ANZCA monitoring
* 5-lead ECG
* Large-bore IV access
* Thoracic epidural  
	* Place at T6-T11
	* Place immediately after IV, to give maximal time for haemostasis prior to intraoperative heparinisation
	* Consider not using immediately, instead only initiating after the ischaemic washout phase is complete.  
	Limits haemodynamic instability if haemorrhage is significant.
* Arterial line  
Pre-induction, in the arm with the higher pre-operative BP.
* CVC  
Generally post-induction, unless required. Transduce CVP.
* Temperature monitoring

##Induction
Haemodynamically stable induction required:
* Consider
	* Fentanyl  
	4-6, up to 10 μg/kg.
	* Remifentanil infusion  
	0.1-0.3 μg/kg/min.

##Intraoperative
###Surgical Stages
The AAA can be divided into 3 phases:

####Pre-Cross Clamp
* Send baseline ABG
* Maintain stable haemodynamics
* Prepare vasodilators
* Draw up heparin  
**100 U/kg**.

####During Cross-clamp  
* SVR increases, leading to an increased in BP  
BP typically increases 7-10% during cross clamp.
	* Begin vasodilators immediately prior to crossclamp
	* Magnitude of this effect is reduced if occlusive aortoiliac disease is prsent  
	As SVR is already high prior to clamping.
* VR reduces as ischaemia of lower limbs occurs.

* Maintain MV to induce respiratory alkalosis
* Optimise circulation:
	* Give volume
	* Prepare vasopressors
	* Avoid negative inotropes
* Protect renal function
	* Some surgeons will request mannitol 0.25-0.5g/kg prior to cross-clamp
* Ensure lower limbs are not actively warmed

####Post-Cross Clamp  
Ischaemic washout of lower limbs occurs, leading to haemodynamic instability due to:
* Immediate fall in SVR  
Increased size of arterial tree.
* Relative hypovolaemia  
Increased size of venous bed.
* Myocardial irritation  
Metabolic waste irritating the ventricles.


* Aim to release one limb at a time, reducing instability
Consider:
	* Volume
	* Vasopressors
	* Reduce anaesthesia

##Postoperative
* ICU or HDC is required  
HDU acceptable if the patient can be extubated.
