#Principles of Thoracic Anaesthesia

*This covers general considerations for thoracic anaesthesia, with the exception of principles (including management of hypoxia) under [one-lung ventilation](/management/resp/olv.md).*

Key considerations:
* Pre-operative optimisation
	* Smoking cessation
	* Exercise
		* Secretion clearance
	* Optimise lungs
		* Bronchodilators
		* Steroids
		* Antibiotics
	* Secretions
		* Chest physiotherapy
		* Spirometry
* Indication
	* Tumour
		* Mass effect  
		Mediastinal mass:
			* Lymphomas  
			Rapidly growing - may cause rapid compression.
			* Germ cell-tumours
			* Thymus
			* Thyroid goitres
		* Metabolic
		* Metastases
		* Medication
	* Bullectomy
	* LVRS
	* Transplant
* Respiratory assessment  
Prediction of post-operative pulmonary function is vital to:
* Confirm suitability  
Stratify to:
	* Curative-intent
	* Defined limits of resection
* Ventilator weaning and post-operative disposition  
Dependent on PPO FEV<sub>1</sub>:
	* ⩾40%  
	Extubate in operating room.
	* 30-40%  
	Consider extubation.
	* ⩽30%  
		* Staged weaning
		* Consider thoracic epidural
* Analgesia plan
	* Use of regional anaesthesia



##Preoperative Assessment{#lung}
Should include:
* Normal history and examination
	* Key comorbidities:
		* Chronic lung disease
		* Smoking history
		* Functional capacity
		* Cardiac comorbidities
	* Acute disease process:
		* Bronchospasm
		* Infection
		* Obstruction.collapse
		* Mass effect
	* Treatment effects
		* Chemotherapy
		* Radiotherapy
* Detailed airway assessment  
Insertion of a DLT is more difficult than SLT.


###Assessment of Pulmonary Function
> * Ability to tolerate:
>	* Resection
>	* [One-lung ventilation](/management/resp/olv.md)
>* Broadly speaking, resection is appropriate if:
>	* FEV<sub>1</sub> ⩾1.5L for lobectomy
>	* FEV<sub>1</sub> ⩾2.0L or 80% predicted for pneumonectomy



The "3-legged" stool of respiratory assessment evaluates a patients ability to **tolerate** removal of an **anatomically resectable** lung cancer. Many approaches have been described; institutional practice will vary depending on the availability of more advanced investigations (e.g. CPET) testing. This is one approach:
* Perform **Spirometry**  
FEV<sub>1</sub> and DLCO are:
	* ⩾60% of predicted  
	Proceed to surgery.
	* <60% of predicted
		* Estimate **predicted postoperative lung function**  
		FEV<sub>1</sub> and DLCO are:
			* ⩾40% of predicted  
			Proceed to surgery.
			* <40% of predicted  
			Perform **CPET testing**  
				* Not always available, and not always performed
				* As measured by **CPET**, or surrogate
				* VO<sub>2</sub> max >15mL/kg/min  
				Most useful predictor of outcome. Indicated by:
					* Stair climb ⩾2 flights
					* 6 minute walk test ⩾610m
					* Exercise SpO<sub>2</sub> <4%)
				* VO<sub>2</sub> max
					* ⩾10mL/kg/min  
					Proceed to surgery.
					* <10mL/kg/min  
					Discuss alternatives.



###Predicted Post-Operative Function Estimation
Predicting post-operative function:
* Estimates the proportion of lung function lost by resection
	* Assumes that all lung segments contribute equally to function  
	Usually not the case as diseased units will inherently perform less well.
* Performed for both FEV<sub>1</sub> and DLCO  
Calculated as $$PPO FEV_1 = Preoperative \ FEV_1 \times {Number \ of \ segments \ initially - Number \ of segments \ resected \over Number \ of \ segments \ initially}$$
	* Normal is **19 segments**


###Risk Stratification
Elevated risk seen with:
* Abnormal blood gases  
Historically used, but convey increase risk if:
	* PaO<sub>2</sub> >60mmHg
	* PaCO<sub>2</sub> <45mmHg
* VO<sub>2</sub>max <15mL/kg/min have very high morbidity and mortality
	* VO<sub>2</sub>max >20mL/kg/min have few respiratory complications
