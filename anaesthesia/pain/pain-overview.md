#Pain

Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. Pain is:
* Distinct from nociception  
Process of nervous system transmission of a noxious stimuli.
* Divided into:
	* Acute pain
	* Chronic pain  
	Pain lasting beyond the time expected for healing following an injury, occurring due to changes in both peripheral and central nervous systems, as well as psychologically.



##Pain Management
Pain management is important as pain:
* Causes suffering
* Limits rehabilitation  
Adequate analgesia facilitates **restoration** of **normal function**.
* Leads to secondary complications
	* Catecholamine release
		* ↑ MVO<sub>2</sub>  
		Ischaemia.
		* Fatigue
	* Stasis
		* Atelectasis/pneumonia
		* DVT
		* Catabolic state
	* Progresses to chronic pain



###Goals of Pain Management
Goals of pain management include:
* ↓ Pain initiation
* Inhibit neurotransmission
* Prevent sensitisation
	* Central
	* Peripheral
* Psychological preparation
	* Set expectations
	* Control pain


##Pain Assessment
> Use the **PASS** assessment:
>	* Pain history
>	* Analgesia and other drug substances
>	* Stress and other psychology
>	* Surgical factors


Key components of a pain history include:
* Site
	* Location
	* Radiation
* Circumstances  
Associated trauma, procedures.
* Character  
Key descriptors.
* Intensity  
Including:
	* At rest
	* With movement
	* Temporal factors
		* Duration
		* Intensity over time
		* Continuous or intermittent
	* Aggravating or relieving factors
* Associated symptoms
* Effect of pain on:
	* Activities of daily living
	* Sleep
* Treatment
	* Current and previous medications
		* Doses
		* Frequency of use
		* Efficacy
		* Adverse effects
	* Other treatment
	* Health professionals consulted
* Relevant medical history
* Factors influencing patients symptomatic treatment
	* Belief around cause
	* Knowledge, expectations, and preferences for management
	* Expected outcome
	* Reduction in pain required for patient satisfaction
	* Coping responses
	* Family expectations



##Mechanism Based Approach
>* Key terms:
>	* Preventative analgesia  
>	Analgesic effect lasts longer than expected duration of drug effet.
>	* Preemptive analgesia  
>	Analgesia provided prior to nociceptive stimulus.
>* Aim to target:
>	* Somatic pain
>	* Visceral pain
>	* Neuropathic pain




###Paracetamol
* Paracetamol given pre- and intraoperatively reduces PONV and improves analgesia, but does ont reduce opioids
* Reduces PONV when given IV  
Effect is independent of its reduction in opioid requirements.


###NSAIDs
* Renal injury is low when used appropriately
* Spectrum of activity between COX-1 and COX-2
* Non-selective NSAIDs:
	* Are associated with increased risk of minor and major bleeding  
	* May precipitate bronchospasm in susceptible patients  
* COX-2 inhibitors **do not**:
	* Impair platelet function  
	Blood loss is reduced compared to non-selective NSAIDs and comparable to placebo after TKR.
	* Precipitate bronchospasm
	* Appear to increase rates of gastric ulceration when used in short courses (5-7 days)
	* Affect bone healing in humans
* Cardiac risk is:
	* Slightly greater with COX-2s
	* Appears dose-related
	* Increased in patients without diagnosed cardiac disease
	* Naproxen and celecoxib have lower risks of myocardial injury than other NSAIDs


###Opioids
> Do not use long-acting opioids in high-risk patients


General opioids:
* Highly effective for somatic pain  
Act pre-synaptically and post-synaptically at multiple points.
* Poor control of visceral pain
* High doses can induce hyperalgesia  
Particularly remifentanil.
* Slow release opioids should not be used as sole agents in early acute pain
* Immediate-release opioids should be used for breakthrough pain
* Pruritus can be reduced using:
	* Naloxone
	* Naltrexone
	* Droperidol
* OIVI  
Particularly in high-risk groups.
	* Sedation 
	Sedation is a better predictor of ventilatory impairment than respiratory rate.
	* ↓ Oropharyngeal tone
	* Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> set point
* Opioid use increases risk of falls and impairs driving


Addiction and divergence:
* Short-term opioid therapy may lead to long term use
* Many patients who retain unused opioid tablets are willing to share them with others
* The most common source of prescription opioids for non-medical use is a friend or relative
* Poorly managed acute pain may reduce retention in opioid-maintenance programs
* Methadone and buprenorphine maintenance should be continued throughout acute pain episodes wherever possible

Patches:
* Transdermal fentanyl patches should not be used in acute pain


PCAs:
* Improve analgesia  
Except where there are high nurse:patient ratios.
* Subcutaneous PCA is as effective as IV PCA
* Improve patient satisfaction
* Increase opioid consumption


Methadone:
* Old, synthetic, and cheap
* Some NMDA affinity
* High interindividual pharmacokinetic variability
* Long half life of up to 60 hours  
May lead to prolonged respiratory depression in overdose.
* High dose may prolong QT interval  
TDP associated with chronic high dose, rather than single perioperative dosing.
* 0.2mg/kg (up to 20mg) at induction reduces PCA use by 48 hours in spinal surgery


Tramadol:
* Mixed receptor activity
* Relatively high NNT
* Effective in neuropathic pain
* Minimal improvement in pain score, but better subjective opinion of pain


Tapentadol:
* Similar efficacy to other opioids with a reduced rate of GIT side effects


Buprenorphine:
* Has a ceiling effect for the respiratory depression but not for the analgesia


###Intrathecal Opioid
>* Lowest effective dose (usually 100-150µg; less than 300µg) should be used
>* Respiratory monitoring should occur for at least 18-24 hours following a single dose


* Intrathecal morphine and fentanyl prolong spinal anaesthetic block
* Morphine is the most commonly studied drug  
Typically 100-500µg used  
	* Generally higher doses used in cardiac or thoracic surgery
	* No benefit seen in exceeding 300µg
	* No strong-dose response relationship demonstrated in meta-analyses
* Quality of analgesia:
	* Similar to epidural for liver resection
	* Duration of ~18-24 hours
		* Reduction in morphine use may extend up to 48 hours
	* Prolongs duration of intrathecal anaesthesia
	* High degree of patient satisfaction, despite side effects
* Complications include:
	* Nausea/Vomiting
	* Pruritus  
	10-15%.
		* Amenable to subcutaneous naloxone
	* Urinary retention
	* Respiratory depression  
		* May be:
			* Hypoxic or hypercapnoeic with an normal respiratory rate
			* Decreased respiratory rate with normal gases
			* **Pupil size** does not correlate with degree of respiratory depression
		* Typically biphasic  
		Second peak is delayed, occurring at 8-12 hours.
		* NNH 15-84  
		More common compared to PCA.


###Intrathecal Adjuncts
* Intrathecal clonidine improves duration of analgesia and anaesthesia
* Intrathecal adrenaline improves duration of analgesia and anaesthesia when used with local anaesthetics



###Epidural Analgesia
Overview:
* Provides better analgesia than system opioids, irrespective of patient or surgery type  
Provides ~ 1/10 reduction in pain over the first 24 hours postoperatively.
* Reduces:
	* Respiratory failure  
	After major surgery in high risk patients; NNT 15.
	* MI risk.
	* Muscle catabolism and subsequent hyperglycaemia
	* Duration of postoperative ileus post-bowel surgery
	* Need for ventilation in rib fractures
	* Incidence of pneumonia and mortality
* Safe
	* Epidural haematoma is vanishingly rare  
		* Anticoagulation and coagulopathy are the two most important risk factors
		* Decompression within 8 hours of symptom onset increases likelihood of partial or good neurological recovery
	* Epidural abscesses  
	Most likely to track from skin: significantly reduced with chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings. 
* Complications
	* Those relating to insertion and management of any epidural
	* Hypotension
		* May require HDU monitoring/vasopressors
		* Better corrected with vasopressors than volume  
		Vasopressors demonstrated to more likely improve GI blood flow than excessive fluid.


Implementation:
* Can be used as a sole technique  
E.g. epidural top-up for LUSCS.
* Can be used as an adjunct to general anaesthesia
	* May be used for either thoracic or abdominal operations
	* Epidural should be sited depending on surgical site
		* Middle of the surgical incision for low-thoracic epidurals
		* Relatively more cranially (i.e. top half) of the incision for high-thoracic epidurals  
		Higher sites of insertion exhibit less cranial spread of epidurally administered LA.
* Use of high concentration (e.g. 0.75% bupivacaine) leads to a rapid onset of sensory and motor blockade  
Motor blockade provides muscle relaxation, decreasing the requirement to administer NMBD.
	* 3-5ml of 0.75% bupivacaine can be used for top-up


###Paravertebral
Paravertebral block:
* Superior analgesia in breast surgery compared to systemic analgesia
* Comparable analgesia but improved side-effect profile compared to epidural analgesia for thoracics


###Analgesic Adjuncts
α2-delta ligands:
* α2-delta ligands  
Probably little in most patients, but good in opioid tolerant.
* Avoid using PRN
* Gabapentin and pregabalin are opioid-sparing
* Gabapentin reduces phantom limb pain


Clonidine:
* Useful in opioid users.


Ketamine:
* Preventive analgesic effect
* Opioid sparing
* Reduces opioid hyperalgesia
* Does not increase ICP or reduce CPP
* Reduces chronic post-surgical pain
* Reduces PONV  
In thoracics.
* May be useful in opioid-resistant pain
* Reduces phantom limb pain


Lignocaine:
* Perioperative IV lignocaine reduces:
	* Pain
	* Opioid requirement
	* PONV
	* Ileus duration
	* Hospital stay


Antidepressants:
* TCA and SNRIs are effective analgesics in chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia
* Duloxetine may be effective in chronic low back pain



###Other
Nitrous oxide:
* Has analgesic efficacy in labour
	* Increases maternal satisfaction
* Neuropathy and bone marrow suppression are rare but potentially serious complications of nitrous oxide use  
Consideration should be given to duration of exposure and supplementation with vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.


Dexamethasone:
* Reduces post-operative pain, as well as PONV and fatigue
* May cause mild hyperglycaemia
* Prolongs duration of sensory and motor block  
Extent is similar when given in the block as to when given systemically.


Other:
* Avoid withdrawal of benzodiazepines in acute pain
* Calcitonin reduces acute (not chronic) phantom limb pain
* No evidence supporting use of cannabinoids
