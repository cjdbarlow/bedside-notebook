#Chronic Post-Surgical Pain

Chronic post-surgical pain occurring at the site of incision or related to surgery and persists a month longer than it takes for most injuries to fully heal. May be:
* A continuation of acute post-surgical pain
* Develops after an asymptomatic period


Chronic pain:
* Complicates **~10%** of all surgeries  
With intolerable pain in ~1%.
* Contributes significantly to the burden of chronic pain
	* Pain
	* Disability
	* Contribution to opioid abuse


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
> Risk factors are proportional to post-operative opioid consumption


**Surgical Factors:**
* Type
	* Breast
	* Inguinal hernia
	* Thoracics
	* Trauma
		* Burns
		* Amputation
	* Involving nerves


**Patient Factors:**
* Chronic Pain
* Uncontrolled acute pain
	* Intensity
	* Duration
	* Analgesic consumption  
	CPSP incidence increased with more analgesic consumption.
* Young
* Female
* Catastrophising  
**How you think**.
* Depression/Anxiety  
**How you feel**.
* Employment status
* Educational level
* Marital status
* Compensation status
* Preoperative opioid use


##Pathophysiology
Multiple pathways:
* Persistent inflammation
* Nerve injury
* Central sensitisation
	* ↑ Receptor density
	* ↑ Sensitivity to all stimulatorly neurotransmitters
	* Touch-pain pathway crossover
	* Hyperalgesia
	* Pain memory and experience

###Aetiology
##Clinical Manifestations
Pain, with:
* Hyperalgesia
* Allodynia

Associated with disturbances to:
* Mood
* Sleep
* Enjoyment of life

##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
Preventative:
* Preemptive analgesia  
Analgesia prior to nociceptive stimulus; e.g.
	* Epidural  
	Reduces CPSP after **thoracotomy**.
	* Spinal
	* Paracetamol
	* Gabapentinoids
* Ketamine  
Perioperative ketamine reduces phantom limb pain magnitude but not incidence.
