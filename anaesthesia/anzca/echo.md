#Training and Practice of Perioperative Cardiac Ultrasound in Adults

Cardiac ultrasound is:
* Valuable
* Associated with risk  
In both:
	* Technique
	* Interpretation
* Divided into:
	* Goal-directed  
	Conducted at point-of-care. Are:
		* Generally qualitative
		* Assess a particular clinical issue
			* Systolic function
			* Filling volumes/pressures
			* Valvular asessment for clinically significant stenosis or regurgitation
			* Potential significant disorders  
			E.g. pericardial collection.
	* Comprehensive  
	May be intraoperative or perioperative.
		* Same study performed irrespective of indication
		* Involve:
			* Multiple windows
			* Quantitative measurement
		* Should be stored to facilitate review  
		Include patient identification, date, and time of ultrasound.
		* Have a formal report produced


##Training
Requires a formal program covering:
* Development of sonographic and interpretive skill
* Cardiac anatomy and pathophysiology
* Demonstration of knowledge base
* Experience conducting and reporting studies
* A minimum number of supervised, unsupervised and reviewed studies
* A recognised qualification

##Documentation and Assessment
Maintain a logbook (or equivalent), covering:
* Nubmer and case mix of examinations
* Level of involvement in each study
* Case review/audit sessions attended
* Training courses completed
