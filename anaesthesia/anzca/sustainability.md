#Environmental Sustainability

Climate change has:
* A significant impact on health outcomes
* Partially resulted from healthcare  
	* **7%** of **Australian CO<sub>2</sub> emissions** are from **healthcare**
	* **5%** of **hospital CO<sub>2</sub> emissions** are from **anaesthesia**



##Personal Responses
Clinical:
* Inhalational anaesthetic agents  
Have significant and sustained environmental impact. Consider:
	* Avoiding desflurane and nitrous oxide
	* Use low-flows
	* Minimise use of inhalational agents when clinically permissible
		* TIVA
		* Regional
* Needles and non-tempered glass medications only in sharps bins
* Rational use of diagnostic tests


Non-clinical:
* Reduce unnecessary travel
* Advocacy
* Research into environmental effects


##Hospital Responses
Infrastructure:
* Heating and cooling considerations
	* Occupancy-sensing
* Water use
	* Auto-off taps	
* Power generation


###Operating Theatre Responses
> * Theatres generate 20-25% of hospital waste
> * 60% of theatre waste is recyclable

Reusable equipment:
* Surgical gowns
* Surgical hats
* Anaesthesia equipment
	* Laryngoscopes
	* LMAs
	* Masks
	* Circuits

Other:
* Reform prefabricated kits to only contain what is necessary
* Avoid unnecessary use of drugs
