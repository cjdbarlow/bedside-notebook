#Guidelines on Infection Control in Anaesthesia

Definitions:
* Asepsis  
Prevention of microbial contamination of living tissues or sterile materials.
* Disinfection  
Inactivation of non-sporing organisms with thermal or chemical means.
* Sterilisation  
Complete destruction of all microorganisms, including spores.

Equipment classifications:
* Critical  
Penetrate skin or mucous membranes, or enters a sterile space. Requires sterilisation.
* Semi-critical  
In contact with intact mucous membranes or becomes contaminated with readily transmissable organisims. Requires sterilisation or high level disinfection.
* Non-critical  
Contacts skin or does not contact the patient. Requires a low-level of disinfection or cleaning.

##Infection Prevention
Precautions:
* Standard precautions  
Gloves, eyewear, gowns, or aprons.
* Gloves  
	* When anticipated contact with body fluids
	* Changed after moving from a contaminated to a non-contaminated body site
* Masks  
When performing a sterile procedure under full aseptic conditions.
* Overshoes
	* Not required if theatre shoes in use
	* Should be worn if shoes are contaminated
	* Hand hygiene should be performed after removing them

Behaviours:
* Hand hygiene  
* Theatre traffic  
Should be minimised, and theatre doors should be closed.
* Sharps  
Should be:
	* Disposed of immediately after use
	* Not resheathed, ben, broken, or manipulated

Active management:
* Antibiotics
* Maintain normothermia
* Restrictive transfusion strategy
* Vaccinations


##Anaesthetic Equipment
Airway equipment:
* Masks  
Semi-critical.
* Laryngoscopes  
Critical, require sterilisation.
* Bronchoscopes  
Semi-critical.
* Bougies  
Single-use preferred.


Anaesthetic breathing systems:
* Circuits  
Can be used for multiple cases provided an HME is in place.
* Breathing bag  
Cleaned between each use.
* Sampling lines  
	* Gas should pass through a viral filter
	* Can be reused
* Surfaces and monitors  
Cleaned with detergent and water between patients.

Ultrasound:
* Surface probes
	* Removal of gel and debris
	* Wiped with detergent cloth
	* Disinfected
* Internal probes  
Semi-critical.

##Invasive Procedures
Require aseptic technique:
* Cannulation
	* Hand hygeine
	* Gloves
	* Skin disinfectant  
	Alcohol only suitable for cannulation ⩽24 hours.
* Central venous cannulation
	* Aseptic technique
	* Maximal barrier precautions  
		* Full body draping
		* Hat, mask, gown, sterile gloves
	* 0.5-2% chlorhexidine skin preparation  
	Tincture of iodine, or 70% alcohol are appropriate if chlorhexidine is contraindicated.

##Drugs
Contamination can be minimised by:
* Using one ampoule only for one patient
* Using filter needs when appropriate
* Wiping rubber stopper of vial with disinfectant prior to aspirating contents
