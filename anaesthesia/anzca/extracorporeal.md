#Major Extracorporeal Perfusion

Circulation of blood through an artificial circuit containing a:
* Pump for assisting circulation
* (Usually) a mechanism for exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide

##Organisation of Service
A hospital providing major extracorporeal perfusion should have:
* A Head of service
	* Responsible for administration and delivery
	* Usually a cardiac anaesthetist or cardiac surgeon
* Appropriate staffing
* Appropriate equipment
* Dedicated space
	* Easy access to operating theatres and intensive care unit
	* Storage of hardware and disposables
* Appropriate training
	* Managing patient on bypass
	* Administration of medication
	* Assembly and operation of bypass equipment
	* For anaesthetic trainees training as medical perfusionists, requirements include:
		* At least 12 months
		* 75 perfusions  
		The first 50 cases should be closely supervised.
	* Critical scenarios including:
		* Pump head failure
		* Gas in the circuit
		* Oxygenator changeout
	* Maintenance
		* At least 40 cases per year

##Equipment
Heart-lung machine should:
* Meet electrical standards
* Undergo routine inspection and maintenance
* Include:
	* Pump heads  
		* 3 or more available
		* Alarms
		* Servo-controlled mechanisms
		* Manual override capability  
		In the setting of:
			* Low blood resevoir
			* Arterial over-pressure
			* Bubble detection
		* Runaway control protection
		* Display of flow  
		In L/min or RPM.
		* Easily calibrated
		* Cranking system
		* Transparent removable covers
	* Gas supply
		* Connect to an indexed piped medical gas system
		* Alarms
		* Emergency oxygen supply
		* Gas flow meters and gas blenders
		* Oxygen analyser  
		Either on:
			* Oxygenator gas supply line
			* Oxygenator effluent gas
		* Scavenger  
		If volatile agents in use.
	* Heat exchanger  
		* May be external or self-contained water supply  
		* Water between:
			* 4 and 42°C
			* 10 and 25 L/min
		* Not at pressures ≥600mmHg
	* Monitoring and alarms  
	Appropriately positioned, maintained, and calibrated.
		* Low-level detection monitor  
		Detects when the blood resevoir runs low.
		* Arterial line pressure monitor
		* Pre- and post-membrane pressure monitor
		* Gas-emboli detector
		* Venous saturation

##Clinical Management
Involves:
* Assembly, checking, and priming of the ECP circuit
* Completion of pre-bypass checklist
* Exclusive availability of the perfusionist for that patient
* Assessment and documentation of coagulation status
* Continuous assessment of physiology and coagulation during ECP
* Appropriate flows, perfusion pressures, gas exchange, and acid-base homeostasis
* Consideration of co-morbid disease
* Appropriate contemporaneous documentation
