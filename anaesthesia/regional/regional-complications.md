#Complications of Regional Anaesthesia
Complications may include:
* LAST
* Vascular injury
* Infection
* Nerve Injury
* Block-specific complications  
Covered in detail under specific blocks; examples include phrenic nerve block after performing a supraclavicular brachial pleuxus block.


##Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity
LAST:
* Occurs in ~1/1,000-1/10,000 regional techniques
	* Cardiac arrest in ~1/25,000
* Risk is reduced by:
	* Aspirating repeatedly during injection
	* Inject LA in discrete boluses
	* Ensure good spread of LA on ultrasound
	* Inject slowly

##Vascular injury
Vascular injury may lead to haematoma and secondary injury due to mass effect. Prevention involves:
* Avoiding vascular injury:
	* Identify vessels prior to injection
	* Choose a needle path that minimises peri-vascular approach
	* Compress veins during needle passage (after they have been identified)
* **Managing anticoagulants**  
Peripheral nerve blocks are low risk for serious bleeding. *In general* (and **in absence of other risk factors**; such as age, renal/hepatic disease, history of major bleeding):
	* Aspirin and NSAIDs do not need to be discontinued  
	* P2Y12 inhibits do not need to be discontinued  
	Includes clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel.
	* Warfarin may safely be continued if INR < 3.0  
	Cessation should be discussed with treating team.
	* UFH should be ceased at least 4 hours before the procedure, and restarted 2 hours after
	* Prophylactic-dose LMWH should be last given at least 12 hours prior
	* Therapeutic-dose LMWH should be last given at least 24 hours prior
	* NOACs may be safely continued  
	Cessation should be discussed with the treating team, and at least 2 drug half-lifes should occur between cessation and intervention.


##Infection
* Risk is increased with use of continuous catheters versus single-shot techniques  
Catheters should be placed under strict asepsis.

##Nerve injury
*This section describes nerve injuries relating to peripheral nerve blocks. Management of central neuraxial injuries are covered elsewhere.*

Nerve injury related to anaesthesia is:
* Defined as a:
	* New onset of pain, weakness, numbness, or abnormal sensation
	* Lasting beyond the usual duration of the specified block
* Rare  
~2-4/10,000 blocks.
* Risk factors
	* Intraneural injection  
	Injection of LA should be performed outside of the connective tissue sheath of the nerve, in the plane of cleavage between epineurium and the extraneural connective tissue layers.
		* Should be a low-pressure, hydrodissection of the space
		* Intraneural injection may be identified as nerve expansion under ultrasound
* Techniques to avoid nerve injury:
	* Avoid injecting if paresthesiae present
	* Use atraumatic needle
	* Notably not reduced with ultrasound guidance


Deficits:
	* Predominantly sensory  
	Paraesthesias.
	* Typically resolve in less than a month:
		* 92% resolve in 1 month
		* 96% in 3 months
		* > 99% in 6 months



###Management of Nerve Injury
* Review:
	* Anaesthetic record
	* Surgical record
	* Drug chart
	* Observations
* Evaluate deficit  
	* Mild/resolving symptoms or persistent sensory deficit
		* Reassure and review in 4 weeks  
		If ongoing persistent symptoms:
			* Neurology referral
			* Consider:
				* MRI
				* Nerve conduction studies
				* Electromyography
	* Complete/progressive deficit or **any motor deficit**
		* Immediate neurological referral
		* Consider:
			* Nerve conduction studies
			* Electromyography
			* Further imaging  
			Expedite if potential requirement for urgent decompression.
		* Consider:
			* Surgical causes
			* Need for surgical intervention
