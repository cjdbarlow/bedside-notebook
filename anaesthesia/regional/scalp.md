#Scalp Block

##Indications
* Craniotomy  
Notable awake craniotomy.
* Repair of scalp lacerations


##Contraindications
##Anatomy
Sensory supply to the scalp:
* Trigeminal nerve  
Three divisions:
	* V1 (Opthalmic)  
	Innervates forehead and anterior scalp via the frontal nerve, which divides in the orbit into the:
		* **Supraorbital nerve**  
		Innervates the forehead and anterior scalp. May be blocked as it exits the supraorbital foramen. 
		* **Supratrochlear nerve**  
		Exits the supraorbital foramen and travels deep to frontalis.
	* V2 (Maxillary)  
	Innervates zygomatic arch via series of cutaneous branches.
		* **Zygomaticotemporal nerve**  
		Innervates a small area of forehead and temporal area.
	* V3 (Mandibular)  
	Innervates peri-auricular scalp via series of cutaneous branches.
		* **Auriculotemporal nerve**  
		Innervates temporal areas, lower lip and face, auricle, and scalp superior to the auricle.
* Cervical plexus  
	* **Greater occipital nerve**  
	Innervates posterior scalp, and sometimes the top of the head and lateral scalp above the ear.
	* **Lesser occipital nerve**  
	Ascends along posterior border of SCM, and innervates scalp posterior to the ear.
	* **Greater auricular nerve**  
	Emerges at posterior border of SCM, and divides into an anterior and posterior branch which provide sensation of parotid, mastoid process, and auricle.

##Equipment
##Technique
Six or seven nerves are blocked during a scalp block:
* **Supraorbital nerve**  
	* Identify the supraorbital notch  
	Located directly above the midpoint of the pupil.
	* Insert needle medial to the supraorbital notch, advance until bone is contacted
	* Withdraw slightly and inject 2-3ml of LA after negative aspiration
* **Supratrochlear nerve**
	* Extend the supraorbital nerve block 1cm medial and inject a further 2-3ml of LA to cover this nerve as it emerges from the superomedial aspect of the orbit   
* **Auriculotemporal nerve**
	* Identify the superficial temporal artery
	* Insert needle 1-1.5cm superior to the tragus, posterior to the temporal artery
	* Advance through temporalis fascia, and spread 3mL of LA deep and superficial to the fascia
* **Zygomaticotemporal nerve**
	* Identify the zygomatic arch, lateral to the lateral canthus
	* Insert needle through temporalis just above zygomatic arch and almost down to periosteum of the temporal bone  
	* Inject 2mL of LA below the fascia


* **Greater occipital nerve**
	* Infiltrate 5mL of LA along the middle third of a line between the occipital protuberance and the mastoid process  
	Variable location of this nerve in this region, but lies medial to the occipital artery (may be palpated). Ensure negative aspiration to avoid occipital artery injection.
* **Lesser occipital nerve**
	* Inject 5mL of LA 2.5cm lateral to the site of the greater occipital nerve block
* **Greater auricular nerve**  
This nerve rarely encroaches on the surgical field for an awake craniotomy and does not usually need to be blocked.
	* Inject ~2cm posterior to the auricle at the level of the tragus; may often be blocked with the lesser occipital


At each site:
* Inject 2-5mL of 0.25-0.5% bupivacaine

##Complications
*General complications of regional techniques are covered under [Principles of Regional Anaesthesia](/anaesthesia/regional/principles.md)*

Specific complications of the scalp block include:
* Cerebral LA toxicity  
CNS effects (including seizures) may occur with very small volumes of intra-arterial LA.
