#Lumbar Puncture and Intrathecal Injection

##Indications


##Contraindications
Absolute:
* Coagulopathy
	* Therapeutically anticoagulated
	* Platelet dysfunction
* Infection

Relative:
* Hypovolaemia
* Intracranial pathology
* Spinal pathology


##Anatomy
Surface anatomy:
* The posterior iliac crests sit at L3/4 or L4/5 in most patients

Layers:
* Skin
* Subcutaneous fat
* Supraspinous ligament
* Interspinous ligament
* Ligamentum flavum  
Thick and harder than other ligaments.
* Epidural space  
Contains fat and blood vessels.
* Dura
* Subarachnoid space  
Contains spinal cord and nerve roots flaoting in CSF.
* Spinal cord  
Ends at L2 in adults and L3 in children.  
	* Puncture above these levels is associated with a risk of cord damage


##Equipment
* Sterile prep  
Should be dried prior to insertion.
* Local anaesthetic and syringe  
For skin. A 23G needle is preferred to a 25G as this is typically long enough to reach (and analgese) the supraspinous ligament.
* Introducer
* Spinal needle
	* Pencil point tips are demonstrated to reduce the incidence of PDPH
	* 25-27G needles are preferred for spinal anaesthesia
		* Smaller needles reduce the incidence of PDPH but also reduce the speed of CSF flow
		* Larger needles may be required in the case of calcified ligament
* (Spinal anaesthetic syringe)  
Use the same volume of syringe each time, and of a different volume to the syringe used for skin LA.
* (Manometer)  
If performing LP.
* (CSF tubes)  
If performing LP.

##Technique
For LP:
* Position the patient
	* Sitting is typically easier as the sagittal plain is aligned
	* Lateral may be required for the uncooperative or sedated, or when measuring CSF pressures
	* Ensure maximal lumbar flexion
* Sterile prep on patient  
Ideally by assistant. Ensure this has dried completely before proceeding.
* Sterile scrub, gown, and glove
* Draw up drugs
	* Skin LA
	* LA +/- opioid for spinal injection
* Place sterile drape
* Locate a suitable interspinous space
	* Feel for the protrusions of a spinous process  
	Deep palpation may be required.
	* Running the thumb down the back can help identify where the optimal space is
* Raise a skin weal of LA  
Typically the best insertion site is lower in the space.
* Further injections of LA into ligament  
Use this opportunity to map the bony anatomy.
* Place introducer into interspinous ligament  
Ensure that a dural puncture is not achieved in thin patients.
	* Perpendicular to skin is the ideal starting direction
* Insert spinal needle through introducer
* If bone is reached, with draw the spinal needle into the introducer and redirect the introducer
* When a loss of resistance is felt, withdraw the introducer
	* Look for clear CSF flow  
	This may take 20-30s in a small-gauge needle, especially if the patient is lateral.
	Replace the stylet and advance the needle further.
* Once free-flow of CSF is obtained:
	* For diagnostic LP:
		* Attach manometer and measure fluid pressure
		* Then fill CSF tubes in series  
		Typically 10 drops in each.
	* For spinal anaesthesia:
		* Attach syringe to spinal needle
		* Aspirate CSF  
		Swirling of CSF within syringe should be seen.
		* Slowly inject local anaesthetic  
		* Repeat aspiration during and at the end of injection
			* Ensures needle remained within CSF throughout and inadvertant epidural injection did not occur
			* Provides **barbotage**  
			May achieve a more rapid onset and extent of block.

###Troubleshooting Insertion
* Unable to locate subarachnoid space
	* Ensure the patient is positioned correctly
		* No shoulder rotation
		* Sagittal planes are aligned
	* Adjusting needle direction
		* Redirect cranially
		* If still hitting bone, redirect cranially again  
		Entering in the bottom of a space assists this approach, as the needle can be 'walked-off' the lower spinous process
		* Redirect caudaly
	* Changing introducer position
		* Move the introducer ~0.5-1cm lower in the space
		* Place the introducer in a different space
	* Use a bigger spinal needle  
		* Thinner needles are more flexible, and may divert their path away from calcified or hard parts of the ligament
	* Conside a lateral approach
* Electrical or stabbing pain  
Needle has likely struct a spinal nerve root within the CSF.
	* Withdraw the stylet and monitor for CSF flow
	* If no flow, withdraw and readjust angle away from side of pain
* Continuous flow of blood  
Needle is likely within an epidural vein.
	* Replace stylet and continue to advance
