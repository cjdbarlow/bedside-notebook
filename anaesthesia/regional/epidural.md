#Epidural {#id}

##Indications and Contraindications
*General contraindications to neuraxial techniques are covered under [principles of neuraxial anaesthesia](/anaesthesia/regional/principles/principles-neuraxial.md).

Epidural catheters are commonly used for:
* Analgesia
    * Adjunct to major abdominal and thoracic procedures  
    In general, offers significant benefit in high-risk patients and high-risk surgery:
        * Reduces stress response
        * Reduces incidence of serious complications
        * Provides excellent analgesia    
        * In combination with a general anaesthetic.
    * Labor
    * Chronic pain
* Anaesthesia
    * As a sole technique, e.g. epidural top-up
    * As a combined spinal-epidural technique


##Equipment


##Technique
* Preparation
* Procedure
* Post
* Removal


###Preparation
* Obtain good IV access  
14-16G.
* Obtain a pre-procedure BP  
Maternal hypertension may suggest pre-eclampsia.
* Obtain consent
* Prepare equipment

####Informed Consent During Labour  
Should still be performed, though is made more difficult by the situation. In general:
* Women wish to be involved in the process
* About 30% of information will be retained
* Written consent is not required  
Verbal consent should be documented.
* Talk between contractions if possible
* Involve the birth partner, particularly if contractions are continuous
* Essential information includes:
    * What will happen  
    The position, what they will feel (e.g. skin local), the need to keep still.
    * Risk of PDPH
    * Risk of failure/inadequate analgesia
    * Risk of instrumental delivery
    * Back pain  
    Over next 1-2 days, but not longterm.
    * Risk of neurological complications  
    Long term ~1:10,000.


###Procedure
* **Position the patient**
Most failures are related to poor positioning.
    * If sitting, ensure:  
        * Flat, level mattress  
        Commonly bed is not level or mother may be sitting on the division in the mattress.
        * Feet flat on a stool
        * As far back on the bed as possible  
        Patients back should be closest to you, with their calves touching the side of the bed.
        * Ensure knees are higher than hips
        * Hold a pillow close to the chest
        * Place chin on chest and relax shoulders
        * Ensure knees, hips, and shoulders are in a line
        * Slump
* Identify the target interspace 
* Prepare the skin  
    * Chlorhexidine is superior  
    Should be kept away and separate from the procedure tray, and allowed to dry fully.
* Hat, gown, glove, drape  
Place a hat on the patient as well.
* Prepare equipment  
Prime catheter with saline.
* Skin local  
23G needle is usually adequate to anaesthetise the interspinous ligament in the non-obese patient.

* Approach may be midline or paramedian
* Insert Tuohy  needle through the skin and supraspinous ligament  
    * Needle will be held firm in the ligament - on letting go the needle will be tethered, whilst it tends to fall if in fat
    * Typically 2-3cm deep
    * Remove stylet/obturator from Tuohy needle and attach loss of resistance syringe
* *Slowly* advance needle and syringe  
    * With saline:
        * Majority of forwards pressure should be on the plunger of the syringe  
        *Just* enough pressure should be applied to the hub of the needle such that minimal saline is injected into the ligament.
            * Too much pressure on the plunger means the ligament becomes oedematous and boggy
            * Too much pressure through the needle hub may lead to accidental dural puncture
        * Consider hydrodissecting the epidural space with saline once it is found, to open up the space in preparation for the catheter  
        Saline commonly flows from the needle afterwards, and may be concerning for dural puncture.
    * With air:
        * Carefully advance the syringe < 1 mm at a time
        * Check for loss of resistance by intermittently ballotting the plunger
        * Minimal air should be injected into the space.
* Remove syringe  
Observe for:
    * CSF  
    Typically continual, brisk flow. If uncertain, can check sample for glucose. See [accidental dural puncture](#adp).
    * **Blood**  
    If blood returns through the Tuohy needle it should be withdrawn. Attempt cannulation at a **different interspace**.
* Thread the catheter  
Warn for potential of transient electric shock feeling.
    * **Never withdraw the catheter through the Tuohy needle**  
    It may shear off and be retained in the epidural space.
* Observe catheter for:
    * Saline  
        * A meniscus should exist in the catheter, and fall as it the catheter is elevated.
        * Continuous flow suggests [dural puncture](adp)  
        Can be confirmed with easy aspiration of CSF, and 
    * **Blood**  
    Indicates cannulation of an epidural vein.
        * Epidural veins can be cannulated during insertion  
        More when the veins are engorged, as occurs in:
            * The sitting position
            * Pregnancy
        * If blood is aspirated from the catheter:
            * Remove the Tuohy needle
            * Pull the catheter back 1-2cm
            * Flush the catheter with saline
            * Lower the catheter to see if blood flows freely  
            If no blood flows, gently aspirate.
            * If:
                * Blood flows or is aspirated  
                Withdraw it 1cm and flush with saline, then check for free-flowing or aspirated blood.
                * No blood flows  
                Cautiously give test dose.
                * Blood flows or is aspirated, and the epidural is 3cm in the space.  
                Remove and try at a different interspace.


* Connect filter  
Can provide first test dose at this stage - see [post-procedure](post).
* Apply dressing  
Can provide second loading dose at this stage.





###Post-Procedure{#post}
* Deliver test dose  
Ensure HR, BP, and SpO<sub>2</sub> monitoring.
* Measure BP Q5 minutely for at least 20 minutes  
Continue longer if BP is labile.
    * BP should be checked 5 minutes after every subsequent top-up or bolus
* Evaluate for intrathecal injection
    * Presence of motor block
* Document procedure  
Should include:
    * Name
    * Date and time
    * Consent and risks discussed
    * Patient position
    * Aseptic techniques used
    * Level, approach, and needle used
    * Loss of resistance technique
    * Technique used
    * Depth to space
    * Presence/absence of CSF, blood
    * Length of catheter in space
    * Bolus dose
    * Efficacy and any neurology
    * Complications


##Complications
* Dural puncture (~1/100)  
Post-dural puncture headache.
* Hypotension (Up to ~1/30)  
May lead to nausea.
* Respiratory depression (~1/200)
* Epidural haematoma (~1/150,000)  
Affected by:
    * Intra-abdominal pressure  
    High IAP impairs epidural venous drainage.
    * Needle size
    * Use of anticoagulants
* Epidural abscess (0.05%)  
* Neurological damage (0.5%)   
    * Typically transient
    * Majority associated with motor block rather than pain
    * Poorer outcomes are associated with:
        * Delayed (> 24 hour) presention
        * No surgical intervention
    * Severe neurological damage is associated with:
        * Delayed diagnosis of haematoma or abscess
        * Haematoma in 50% of cases
        * Administration of heparin intraoperatively in > 50% of cases
        * Presence of pre-existing coagulation abnormality in 75% of cases
* High block
* Urinary retention  
    * IDC placement
* Itch  
    * Due to presence of opioids within epidural



##Management
Dosing Epidurals:
* In general:
    * Ropivacaine 3-4mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>.6 hours<sup>-1</sup>
    * Bupivacaine 2-3mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>.6 hours<sup>-1</sup>
* Dose reduce in:
    * Hepatic failure
    * Renal failure
    * Severe hypoalbuminaemia

###Catheter Removal
Removal of an epidural can occur when:
* Coagulation status is normal  
Covered under [coagulopathy](/anaesthesia/regional/principles/principles-neuraxial.md#coag).
* No longer therapeutically indicated
* Risk of infection is too high to justify ongoing use
Typically epidurals may stay up to **5 days** following insertion, though local procedure may vary.
    * This needs to be balanced against the requirement for ongoing analgesia

Removing the catheter:
* Remove dressing
* Apply gentle pressure to remove the catheter
* Tip of catheter should be visible
* If **catheter does not come out easily**  
Place the patient in the same position they were in for insertion, and pull gently.


###Accidental Dural Puncture {#adp}
Following dural puncture, one can either:
* **Use as** an **intrathecal catheter**  
This is a higher risk technique.
    * Pass epidural catheter and leave 2-2.5cm in the space
    * **Label clearly as SPINAL**
    * *Cautiously* establish block  
    Typically, intrathecal doses are ~1/10<sup>th</sup>sup> of epidural doses.
        * Consider using 2mg bupivacaine and 5μg fentanyl
    * Consider leaving the catheter in post-delivery as this reduces the incidence and severity of PDPH
* Remove and repeat
    * Higher risk of subsequent dural puncture
    * Cautiously test dose repeat epidural  
    Some LA may migrate intrathecally.
