#Spinal Surgery
>Time: Variable  <br>
>Pain: Variable, but may be severe (especially with scoliosis fixation)  <br>
>Position: Typically [prone](/anaesthesia/general/proneanaes.md), though anterior (supine) and lateral approaches may be used <br>
>Blood loss:  May be substantial in multi-level operations <br>
>Special Drugs


Spinal surgery is generally performed under GA, but may use epidural for post-operative analgesia, especially in scoliosis operations. Anaesthetic considerations vary depending on the operation:

|Operation|Time|Position|Surgical Stages|Blood Loss|Pain|Other|
|--|--|
|Microdisectomy|1-2 hours|Prone|Skin incision, dissection of erector spinae, laminotomy, rhizolysis (stimulating)| Minimal|Typically NSAIDS and LA adequate|Day case|
|Cervical discectomy|2 hours|Prone, may have pins||Minimal|More opioid may be required|May have neurology - emergency|
|Spinal fusion|1+1 per level|Prone||May be substantial. G+H, cross-match units|Substantial|May need bone grafts|
|Cervical fusion|3 hours|Supine or prone with pins||Less than for lumbar or thoracic. G+H|Regular opioid may be required|May need FOI due to unstable spine. Pins are stimulating|
|Tumour|2-6+ hours|Supine or prone||Potential for massive transfusion. G+H, cross-match.|Regular opioid required|Surgically challenging|
|Scoliosis corection|3-6+ hours|Supine or prone||Potential for massive transfusion. G+H, cross-match|Severe pain, often in patients with history of chronic pain. Seek advice.|May have restrictive respiratory disease.|
|Fracture fixation|2-6 hours|Supine or Prone||May be substantial. G+H, cross-match.|May be severe if multiple levels involved|Other injuries and physiological state may make anaesthesia challenging|


##Considerations
May be highly variable, and depending on the position, number of levels, and the patient. Important factors:
* A  
	* Must be secured in prone position
	* Consider use of a **reinforced tube** with a **bite block** to prevent kinking and occlusion
	* Risk of cord oedema and inability to extubate after a long case
* B
	* Test ventilatiojn once positioned
* C
	* Secure venous access is vital
	* MVE with 3-way tap recommended if cannula is not accessible
* D
	* Analgesia requirements vary widely and may be substantial
* E
	* Active warming and temperature montioring is required
	* Risk of pressure area and nerve injury
		* Breasts and genitals
		* Face
		* Upper limbs  
		Especially if arms are above the head, which puts traction on the brachial plexus.
* H
	* Blood loss may be substantial
