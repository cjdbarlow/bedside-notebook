#Regional Anaesthesia for Caesarian Section
*[General principles](luscs.md) of caesarian section and [general anaesthesia for caesiarian](ga-luscs.md) are covered separately.*

Provision of regional anaesthesia for a [caesarian section](/luscs.md):
* Has many advantages over GA:
	* Mother and support person can be present at delivery
	* Lower risk  
	Predominantly due to less aspiration.
	* Alert neonate  
	Early bonding and breastfeeding.
	* Better postoperative analgesia and mobilisation
* Requires a **block level from T4-S4** to light touch and ice
* Can be performed with:
	* Single-shot **spinal**  
	Most (>90%) CS are performed under spinal.
		* Rapid onset
		* Simple (usually)
		* < 1% failure rate
		* More rapid sympathectomy than epidural, leading to greater haemodynamic disturbance  
		Can be avoided with use of phenylephrine infusion.
		* Shorter acting, and difficult to correct  
		Avoid if procedure is expected to be >2 hours in duration.
	* **Epidural top-up**  
	Used when a working epidural is already present  
		* Easy
		* Greater haemodynamic stability at cost of slower onset  
		The poorer the intitial block, the harder it is to top up.
		* Generally poorer block than spinal
		* Additional top-up can be given intraoperatively
		* Epidural can be used for post-operative analgesia
	* **CSE**
		* Technically more difficult
		* Greater haemodynamic stability
		* Allows block to be extended if surgery is prolonged
		* Epidural can be used for post-operative analgesia

##Preoperative Assessment
* E
	* BMI  
	Affects technical difficulty.
	* Previous back surgery  
	May make procedure harder or inadvisable.


##Preparation
Adequate patient preparation and **expectation management** is key:
* Discuss with patient that:
	* Spinal does not remove all sensation
	* It will be uncomfortable at certain points, and this is normal
		* Pull prior to uterine incisoin
		* Upper abdominal pressure to deliver baby
	* Pain should not occur
* Sitting position preferred if patient will tolerate this
* Premedication is acceptable for anxiolysis
	* Midazolam 0.02mg/kg


##Induction and Maintenance
>"It is easier to manage a high block than an inadequate one"

Covers:
* [Single-shot spinal](#sss)
* [Epidural top-up](#etu)
* [Combined Spinal-Epidural](#cse)

###Single-shot Spinal{#sss}
*Detailed approach to performance of spinal anesthesia is covered [here](/anaesthesia/regional/spinal.md).*

* Perform spinal  
[Many different options for dosing](#dosing). A reliable recipe (with a total volume of 3ml) is:
	* 2.2ml of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine
	* 15μg of fentanyl
	* 100μg intrahtecal morphine
* Lie supine with pillow
	* Trendelenburg can be used to increase the cranial spread
	* Reverse trendelenburg will reduce cranial spread   
	Increase the degree of tilt if block is rising/rises too cranially.
* Place wedge
* Commence phenylephrine infusion  
30ml/hr of 100μg/ml solution.
* Test the block
	* No block  
		* Consider repeat spinal  
		May cause exaggerated haemodynamic response.
		* Consider GA
	* Inadequate block  
	Consider epidural and slow titration of LA.

####Principles of Spinal Dosing{#dosing}
In general:
* Much research has been done
* Little of it demonstrates significant superiority for one technique over another
* Local anaesthetics:
	* Bupivacaine 8-12mg  
	Block will recede after 1.5 hours, though some block will remain after 2.5 hours.
		* Hyperbaric bupivacaine has a more rapid onset and the level can be adjusted by moving the table
	* Lignocaine generally avoided because of transient neurological symptoms
	* Ropivacaine has a much shorter intrathecal duration of action
* Opioids  
May be added to improve analgesia intra- and post-operatively.
	* Fentanyl 10-25μg
	* Morphine 50-150μg  
	Provides longer lasting analgesia in exchange for risks of PONV, pruritis (can be severe), and late respiratory depression.


###Epidural Top-Up{#etu}
* Examine the back and make sure the catheter has not moved
* Test the current block  
* Incrementally top up epidural
	* 2% lignocaine with 1:200,000 of adrenaline  
	10-12ml initial bolus, with further 5ml Q2-3 min, up to 7mg/kg.
	* Additional opioid  
	e.g. 100μg fentanyl.
* Test the block  
	* No block  
	Catheter may be inadequately positioned. Consider:
		* Resiting epidural
		* Peforming spinal
	* Inadequate block  
	Epidural may be resited or withdrawn.
		* Consider
			* Further top-up  
			Ensure that further top-ups will not prohibit performing a spinal if required.
			* Spinal
		* If LA dose limit has been reached:
			* Consider abandoning  
			For elective procedures.
			* Convert to GA  
			For emergency procedures.

###Combined Spinal-Epidural{#cse}
* Sit patient up
* Perform CSE  
Can be performed as:
	* Needle-through-needle technique
	* Two-needle technique
* Dosing
	* Most cases given a full-dose spinal with subsequent epidural top-up if required
	In addition to top up with LA, 10mls 0.9% NaCl can be given through the epidural to compress the dural sac and encourage cranial spread of intrathecal LA.
	* Can alternatively give a half-dose spinal, followed by intentional titration  
	More haemodynamically stable, and confirms adequate positioning of epidural.
* Test the block  
As per [epidural top-up](#etu).


##Complications of Regional Techniques in Caesarian Section
* Bradycardia
	* May be due to vena cava compression or blockade of cardioaccelerator fibres
	* Should be treated if <50 and associated with hypotension
	* 200-400ug glycopyrrolate is the preferred agent  
	Does not cross placenta.


* Nausea and vomiting  
	* Predominantly due to hypotension
	* May be due to visceral manipulation or rapid administration of oxytocic  
	Amenable to vasopressors.


* Hypotension  
	* First line treatment should be pressor agents  
	Adjust phenylephrine infusions, covered [here](#prep).


* Inadequate blockade
	* Pain  
		* Generally due to no block of high thoracic dermatomes.
		* Alternate technique required in up to 10%
		* Additional analgesia required in up to 15%  
		Options include:
			* Reassurance
			* Epidural top-up (if available)
			* Nitrous oxide
			* IV opioid  
			Alert paediatrics if this is given prior to delivery. Short acting agents preferred:
				* Alfentanil
				* Fentanyl
			* Conversion to GA  
				* Generally comply with this if the patient requests it and risk is not extreme
				* Often required if pain occurs before foetal delivery
				* Occurs in 2%


* High spinal
