#Trial of Forceps/Operative Vaginal Delivery

Operative delivery is:
* Indicated for:
	* Foetal compromise
	* Maternal effort contraindicated
	* Need to expedite second stage
* Performed with forceps or ventouse
* Not always performed in theatre  
**Need for OT** generally **reflects** liklihood of failure and **requirement to convert to caesarian section**  
	* Caesarian following attempted instrumental delivery is complex  
	Associated with increased morbidity:
		* Maternal
			* Major PPH
			* Transfusion
			* Cystotomy
			* Hysterectomy
			* ICU admission
		* Foetal
			* Neonatal acidosis
			* ICH
			* Requirement for resuscitation
* Analgesia requirements vary  
Anaesthesia usually only involved in OT.
	* Pudendal nerve block
	* Field block
	* Neuraxial (including labour epidural)  
	May be required for mid-rotational positions.


##Induction
If being performed in theatre, it is safer to assume the forceps will fail (although ~2/3<sup>rds</sup> are successful) and caesarian will be performed:
* Spinal  
Consider omitting long-acting intrathecal opioid - discuss with obstetrician liklihood of successful forceps delivery.
* Epidural top-up  
Give standard dose top-up.
