#Principles of Caesarean Section {#id}

*This covers general principles of caesarian section. Particulars of caesarian section performed under [general](ga-luscs.md) or [regional](reg-luscs.md) anaesthesia are covered elsewhere.*

>Time: 45 to 90 minutes <br>
>Pain: Significant opioid requirement post-operatively<br>
>Position: Supine <br>
>Blood loss: G+H required. Typically 500-100, but can be substantial. <br>
>Special Drugs: Oxytocin post-delivery

Caesarian section is delivery of a foetus through an abdominal incision. A caesarian section can be performed:
* At **different degrees of urgency**  
Divided into 4 categories:
	* **Cat 1**  
	Imminent threat to life of mother or foetus.
		* Objective is to deliver baby as rapidly as possible whilst being safe  
		Epidural top-up (if available) or GA otherwise. Spinal is associated with ~8-10 minute additional anaesthetic time.
	* **Cat 2**  
	Maternal or foetal compromise that is not imminently life threatening.
	* **Cat 3**  
	No compromise, but requires early delivery.
	* **Cat 4**  
	No compromise, delivery timed to suit the mother and the hospital.
* With **different techniques**:
	* **[General Anaesthesia](ga-luscs.md)**  
		* Quick to perform and reliable
		* Allows fastest delivery of baby
		* Generally increased risk of complications
		* Indications:
			* Maternal request
			* Cat 1 CS without pre-existing epidural  
			* Contraindication to regional technique
			* Failure of regional technique  
			May be:
				* Prior to incision
				* After incision  
				Limited consent and preparation time.
			* Expected massive haemorrhage
	* **[Regional](reg-luscs.md)**  
		* Preferred method in absence of contraindications
		* Includes:
			* Spinal
			* CSE
			* Epidural top-up


##Considerations{#considerations}
* A
	* Probably higher risk of difficult airway
		* Mallampati score increases both during pregnancy and during labour
	* Higher risk of aspiration
* B
	* Reduced FRC and increased VO<sub>2</sub> in pregnancy lead to faster desaturation
	* Respiratory function may be compromised with regional techniques
* C
	* HDx state may be compromised with regional techniques  
	Avoid if significant antepartum blood loss.
* D
	* Consent  
	Depth of consent will be tailored to clinical urgency.
	* Anxiety
		* Often first exposure many people have to the hospital system  
		Aim to make it a positive one.
		* Regional and neuraxial anaesthesia are anxiety-inducing
* G
	* Antacid prophylaxis
* H
	* Group and Hold  
	There is always a risk of massive haemorrhage with obstetric cases.
* O
	* Placenta position  
	Low-lying anterior placenta greatly increases risk of major haemorrhage, especially if there is a scar from previous CS.
	* Obstetric factors influencing anaesthetic technique:
		* Pre-eclampsia  
		Generally, early epidural prior to thrombocytopenia is preferred.
		* Prematurity  
		Generally, regional techniques reduce foetal morbidity.
		* Post-dates  
			* Often require LUSCS
			* Regional techniques generally preferred
		* Breech presentation
			* Elective LUSCS improves neonatal outcomes
			* Regional preferred in elective LUSCS
		* Multiple Gestation
			* Early epidural provides route enables quick conversion to LUSCS in second-twin distress
			* GA for cat 1 LUSCS


##Preoperative Assessment
Specific factors include:
* Gestational history
	* Previous CS and issues
* Issues with current pregnancy
	* Pre-eclampsia
	* Placenta position
* Expected operative duration
	* Multiple previous abdominal surgeries
	* Multiple previous caesarian sections
	* Combined operation  
	e.g. hysterectomy.


###Indications for Antenatal Anaesthetics Review
* A
	* Previous airway issues
* B
	* Poorly controlled asthma
	* Respiratory disease that impairs ADLs
* C
	* Valvular disease
	* Arrhythmias
	* Congenital cardiac disease
	* PPM/ICD
	* Pulmonary hypretension
* D
	* Chronic pain
	* Intracranial lesions
	* Neuromuscular disease
	* Spinal anatomy disease that may limit neuraxial options
* E
	* Morbid Obesity
	* History of MH
* H
	* Coagulopathy
	* Thrombocytopaenia
	* Refusal for blood products


##Preparation{#prep}
* Give **antacid prophylaxis**
	* Ranitidine 150mg PO  
	2 hours prior to surgery.
	* 30ml sodium citrate  
	Immediately prior.
* Standard ANZCA monitoring  
Cycle BP cuff minutely from induction until delivery.
	* Treat hypotension aggressively with vasopressor  
	Treat nausea aggressively with vasopressor, as this is often a sign of hypotension.
* Give supplemental oxygen if < 95% on air
* **Wedge**  
Under right hip to displace the gravid uterus off the IVC, and ensure venous return.
* Large IVC  
16G or bigger ideal, 18G acceptable.
* Start phenylephrine infusion on commencement of anaesthesia, aiming to preserve the baseline BP  
**Generally 30**-60**ml/hr of 100ug/ml of phenylephrine**.
	* Adjust infusion rate each minute depending on the blood pressure  
	25-50% increments are reasonable.
	* Phenylephrine is the preferred agent as it does not constrict the spiral arteries
	* 100μg bolus can be used to treat hypotension
* Ensure **oxytocin available**
* Prophylactic antibiotics  
Should be given prior to skin incision.


##Intraoperative
This section is divided into:
* Surgical stages
* General complications of CS
* Complications of regional techniques in CS
* Complications of GA in CS


###Surgical Stages
* Test block (if regional)
* Transverse laparotomy  
Generally little muscle relaxation is required.
* Peritoneal retraction
* Uterine incision  
If amnion is intact then amniotic fluid will enter abdominal cavity.
* Delivery
* Uterine closure and haemostasis


###General Complications of CS
* Massive haemorrhage
* Amniotic fluid embolism
* Post-partum haemorrhage  
Typically due to poor tone.
	* Uterine massage
	* Oxytocin


##Postoperative
Most departments have a standard post-operative analgesia management protocol. Consider:
* Paracetamol 1g QID
* Ibuprofen 400mg TDS
* Tramadol 50-100mg IV/PO QID
* Ondansetron 4-8mg IV/SL TDS
* Metocloparmide 10mg IV/PO TDS

* If intrathecal morphine given:
	* Naloxone 40μg SC Q1H  
	For itch.
	* Naloxine 100μg IV Q5 min  
	For RR < 8.
* If no intrathecal morphine given:
	* Oxycontin 20mg SR BD (wean in 1-2/7)
