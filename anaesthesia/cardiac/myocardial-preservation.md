#Myocardial Preservation
Methods to reduce myocardial injury include:
* General
	* Cardiovascular stable anaesthetic
	* Hb 7-10g/dL
	* MAP >65mmHg
	* CPP >50mmHg
	* Low HR
	* Avoid ventricular distension  
	Increases wall tension and VO<sub>2</sub>; resolve with venting.
	* Ensure good venous return to reservoir
* Preconditioning  
Exposure to stimulus reduces subsequent ischaemic injury.
	* Ischaemic
	* Pharmacological
		* Halogenated volatiles
		* Xenon
		* Opioids
		* Adenosine
		* β-blockers
		* Lignocaine
		* Nicorandil
* Cardioplegia  
Goal is to maintain electromechanical arrest.
	* Reduces myocardial VO<sub>2</sub> to ~20%
	* Provides O<sub>2</sub> and glucose
	* Multiple types
* Hypothermia  
	* Reduces O<sub>2</sub> demand  
	~50% per 10°C.
	* Promotes electromechanical arrest


##Cardioplegia
Options may include:
* Blood  
Oxygen and buffering capacity.
	* Hb ~5g/dL
* Crystalloid


Reperfusion may be:
* Warm or cold
* Intermittent or continuous
