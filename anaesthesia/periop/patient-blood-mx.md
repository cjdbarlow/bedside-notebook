#Patient Blood Management

Patient Blood Management:
* Aims to reduce unnecessary transfusions  
Transfusion is associated with:
	* Mortality in both:
		* Cardiac and non-cardiac surgery
		* Short-term and 5 year mortality
	* Morbidity:
		* ↑ Length of stay
		* ↑ Postoperative infections
		* TRIM
	* Cost
* Involves:
	* Early detection and treatment of anaemia
	* Minimising perioperative blood loss
	* Improving post-operative tolerance to anaemia



##Anaemia
Anaemia is:
* Defined as a (sea-level) haemoglobin of:
	* ⩽130g/dL in men
	* ⩽120g/dL in non-pregnant women
	* ⩽110g/dL in pregnant women
* An independent risk factor for:
	* Mortality
	* Morbidity
	* Hospitalisation
	* ↓ Quality of Life
* Associated with ↑ transfusion requirements  


###Epidemiology
Anaemia in preoperative patients in Australia is:
* Common
	* 6% of females
	* 2% of males
	* Risk increases with age  
	16% of patients over 75.
* Usually due to iron deficiency

###Assessment
Assess 4-6 weeks preoperatively:
* FBE  
	* Hb
	* MCV  
	Classies anaemia into:
		* Microcytic  
		MCV ⩽ 80 fl. Major causes are:
			* Iron deficiency
			* Congenital haemoglobinopathies
		* Normocytic  
		MCV 80-96 fl. Major causes are:
			* Anaemia of chronic disease
			* Pregnancy
			* Haemolysis
			* Sickle-cell
		* Macrocytic  
		MCV ⩾96 fl. Major causes are:
			* Folate/Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiecy
			* Alcohol
			* Drug effect
	* MCHC
	* RCC
* Blood film
* CRP  
Performed if ferritin is raised in a microcytic anaemia, to exclude reactive causes.
* Iron studies
	* Ferritin  
	Assesses degree of iron deficiency.
		* Only reliable in absence of acute inflammation  
		Ferritin is an acute phase reactant
		* Normal range will depend on lab assay, but in general:
			* Severe: ⩽30μg/mL
			* Moderate: 30-50μg/mL
			* Mild: 50-100μg/mL
	* Transferrin saturation
		* <20% suggestive of iron deficiency
		* Useful in moderate ferritin deficiency


###Management
Therapeutic options:
* Depend on:
	* Surgical urgency  
	Aim to schedule surgery once red cell mass optimised.
	* Patient availability
	* Cause of anaemia
* Include:
	* Preoperative iron Supplementation  
	If iron deficient.
		* Oral
			* Common
			* Cheap
			* Significantly limited by:
				* Time  
				May take ⩾3 months of therapy to be effective, and 6-9 months for equivalent effect of one IV replacement.
				* Absorption  
				Highly variable.
				* Intake
				* Non-compliance  
				Significant GI side effects.
			* 80mg elemental iron given every **second day**  
			Daily administration down-regulates hepcidin, and reduces absorption.
		* IV
			* Facilitate rapid repletion of stores
			* Requires local pathway to facilitate
			* Newer preprations have much lower incidence of anaphylaxis  
			Include iron polymaltose and iron carboxymaltose.
	* Erythropoiesis
		* May be useful in patients:
			* With renal disease
			* Without nutritional deficiency
		* Should be coordinated with haematologist and nephrologist

##Minimising Perioperative Blood Loss
Preoperative optimisation:
* Identifying and managing bleeding list
* Reviewing medications

###Management
Intraoperatively involves:
* Surgical
	* Meticulous haemostasis
	* Topical haemostatics
* Anaesthetic
	* Avoid coagulopathy
		* Temperature ⩾35°C
		* pH ⩾7.2
		* iCa ⩾1mmol/L
	* Anaesthetic blood-sparing techniques  
	Central neuraxial blockade reduces perioperative bleeding, especially in orthopaedics.
	* TXA  
	If EBL ⩾500mL.
	* Cell salvage  
	If EBL ⩾1L.


Postoperatively involves:
* Preventing secondary haemorrhage
* Minimising iatrogenic blood sampling
	* Reduce sample volumes
	* Using continuous sampling lines

##Postoperative Anaemia Tolerance
Goals are to:
* Maintain DO<sub>2</sub>
	* Optimise CO
	* Optimise oxygenation and ventilation
	* Use appropriate transfusion thresholds  
		* Hb 70g/dL in patients without underlying cardiac disease
		* Hb 80g/dL in patients with cardiac disease
		* Transfuse smallest volume possible  
		i.e. Single units, if clinically appropriate.
* Minimise excess VO<sub>2</sub>
	* Rapidly treat infections/sepsis
