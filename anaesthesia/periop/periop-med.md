#Perioperative Management of Medications

*This covers perioperative management of medications, with the exception of:*
* *[Anticoagulants](/anaesthesia/periop/periop-anticoag.md)*
* *[Antiplatelets](/anaesthesia/periop/periop-antiplatelet.md)*
* *[Insulin and Oral Hypoglycaemics](/disease/endo/dm.md#anaes)*




##Respiratory Medications
Inhaled bronchodilators:
* Continue  
Decrease risk of post-operative respiratory complications.


Theophylline:
* Withhold from day prior to surgery  
Multiple potential pharmacokinetic interactions.


##Cardiac Medications{#card}
Alpha 2 agonists:
* Continue if already taking  
Give parentally if will be NBM.


ACE-Is/A2RBs:
* Generally withhold, however:
	* Favour continuing if for cardiac failure or poorly controlled hypertension to avoid exacerbation
	* Favour withholding if intraoperative hypotension likely or problematic  
	If withheld, restart as soon as possible.

Beta-blockade:  
* Continue if already taking
* **Consider starting**:
	* If indicated and therapy can be initiated 2-4 weeks prior to surgery
	* In patients with known ischaemic heart disease or myocardial risk factors  
	* In patients with RCRI ⩾3
* If initiating, it is ideal to begin long enough in advance to evaluate safety and tolerability  
	* At least 2-7 days
	* ⩽1 day harmful


Calcium Channel Blockers:
* Continue if already taking


Non-statin lipid-lowering agents:
* Discontinue if taking  
May interfere with oral absorption of other medications, and contribute to myopathy.


Statins:
* Should be continued
* Consider initiation in patients:
	* Undergoing vascular surgery
	* Who have an indication and are undergoing elevated risk procedures

Diuretics:
* Depends on indication:
	* For hypertension  
	Withhold on morning of surgery.
	* For cardiac failure
		* Well controlled with stable volume state  
		Withhold on morning of surgery.
		* Poorly controlled or previous problems with fluid overload  
		Continue.



##CNS Agents
Antidepressants:
* SSRIs/SNRIs  
Generally continue, however:
	* May be ceased if substantial concern about bleeding  
	Should be weaned off:
		* Over several weeks
		* With psychiatrist involvement
		* And consideration of starting an alternative anaesthetic regimen
* MAO-Is  
Generally cease 2 weeks prior.
	* Risk of profound hypertension with indirect acting sympathomimetics  
	Directly acting agents (noradrenaline, adrenaline, phenyephrine, isoprenaline) are safe when used judiciously.
	* May be continued if:
		* Anaesthetist comfortable with MAO-safe anaesthesia
		* Psychiatrist concerned about exacerbation of psychiatric disease with drug cessation
* Lithium/Valproate  
Generally continue perioperatively due to concerns about exacerbating underlying disease. Ensure regular monitoring of:
	* Fluids
	* Electrolytes
	* Serum lithium levels
* TCAs  
May be continued but:
	* Preoperative 12-lead ECG and intraoperative 5-lead ECG should be performed  
	***If* ceased** due to concerns about arrhythmia, should be **tapered off 7-14 days** prior to surgery.
	* Tramadol and meperidine should be avoided
	* Atropine or scopolamine may increase perioperative confusion



##Endocrine Medications
OCP: 
* Consider ceasing **4 weeks** prior if high VTE risk.


Thyroxine:
* Should be continued perioperatively
* Requires parental administration if cannot be resumed within 5-7 days perioperatively


Glucocorticoids:
* Chronic glucocorticoid therapy may suppress the HPA axis and prevent an appropriate adrenal response to physiological stress  
In absence of glucocorticoids, endogenous cortisol release:
	* Increases even with minor surgery or illness  
	Increase may be 5 to 50 times normal, depending on degree of insult.
	* May persist for days  
	Normalise within 24 hours for small insults, and 5 days for larger insults.
* Addition of "stress dose" steroids perioperatively is common practice, although lacks a strong evidence base
* In general, patients:
	* **Do not** have HPA suppression with:
		* Prednisolone doses <5mg/day
		* Any dose of glucocorticoid for <3 weeks
	* **Do** have HPA suppression with:
		* Prednisolone doses >20mg/day
		* Evidence of Cushing's syndrome
* Stress-dosing varies on degree of surgical stress:
	* Minor stress  
	Take usual steroid dose.
	* Moderate stress  
	Take usual steroid dose, and supplement with:
		* 50mg Hydrocortisone IV pre-procedure
		* 25mg Hydrocortisone Q8H for 24/24
	 * Severe stress  
	 Take usual steroid dose, and supplement with:
	 	* 100mg Hydrocortisone IV pre-procedure
	 	* 50mg Hydrocortisone Q8H for 24/24
	 	* Taper hydrocortisone dose by half each day until maintenance steroid dose reached


##Complementary and Alternative Medicines
>In general, **ceasing** all herbal/**complimentary medicine 2 weeks prior** is a safe approach

Specific medications:
* Ephedra  
Cease 24 hours prior; increased cardiac risk.
* Garlic  
Cease 7 days prior; increased bleeding risk.
* Ginkgo balboa  
Cease 36 hours prior; increased bleeding risk.
* Ginseng  
Cease 7 days prior; increased hypoglycaemia.
* Kava  
Cease 24 hours prior; pharmacokinetic interactions with anaesthetic agents.
* St. John's Wort  
Cease 5 days prior; multiple pharmacokinetic interactions.
* Valerian root  
Tapered weeks pre-operatively; increased sedation with anaesthesia.
* Echinacea  
Increased hypersensitivity.
