#Considerations in Paediatric Anaesthesia
*This section covers various considerations for paediatric anaesthesia. The [anaesthetic assessment of a paediatric patient](/assessment/anaesthetic/paeds.md) is covered elsewhere.*

Paediatric anaesthesia:
* Presents its own unique challenges
	* Technical  
	Small airways, veins.
	* Psychological
		* Child  
		* Parents
* Is more similar to adult anaesthesia than it is different


##Age-Independent Factors
Airway:
* ↓ Airway diameter  
ETT diameter significantly affects airway resistance.

Breathing:
* Notably **similar tidal volume** of 7mL/kg
* Similar **dead space volume**  
However apparatus dead space becomes proportionally more important.

Circulation:
* Absence of coronary disease means children will tolerate significant doses of anaesthesia without circulatory compromise  
Assuming no congenital cardiac disease present.

Neurological:
* Significant anxiety is common to both children and parents around time of surgery:
	* Parental anxiety is:
		* Common
		* Often exaggerated understanding of risk
	* Child anxiety is common, and exacerbated by:
		* Lack of understanding
		* Lack of cooperation


###Allaying Anxiety
Use of language:
* Positive language  
Remove words with negative associations, e.g. pain.
	* "You'll usually wake up pretty comfortable, we'll give you extra medicine to make you more comfortable, and a nurse will be there to give you more medicine to keep you comfortable."
* Emphasis on safety rather than risk
* Reinforce positive behaviours
* Don't downplay pain and anxiety  
Says things will hurt if they will hurt.
* Reassure that concerns and anxiety is normal, but magnitude of risk of low in well children
* Project a sense of relaxation
* Engage in normal conversation with the parents and child


##Key Differences
This section covers key differences from adults relevant to paediatric anaesthesia, broken up by age groups.

###Premature, Neonates, and Infants
This group:
* Present the greatest:
	* **Technical** challenges  
	Both in difficulty, and in difference from adults.
	* Requirement for additional resources
* Probably has the highest parental anxiety
* Should have age calculated as **post-conceptual age**  
$$PCA = Weeks \ of \ Gestation + Weeks \ since \ Birth$$. 


|System|Premature|Neonate|Infant (up to 2 years)|
|---|---|
|**A**|- Very small everything<br>- Best lying flat for intubation<br><br>- Consideration of Mac vs. Miller<br>- BVM usually **straightforward**<br>- Intubation can be difficult<br>- Small ETTs are high resistance|- As premature|- Difficult one-hand mask ventilation due to obstructed nasal passages<br>- Small ETTs are high resistance|
|**B**|- Surfactant may be inadequate<br>- **Apnoeas**<br>- Desaturate *very* quickly<br>- Difficult to preoxygenate<br>|- As premature<br>- Essentially never appropriate for day-case surgery|- Frequent URTIs<br>- Smaller airway diameter = bad bronchospasm|
|**C**|- Foetal shunts may be open/reopen<br>- Normal MAP ≈ weeks of gestation|- HR dependent CO<br>- **Defend HR**|- Most difficult group for IV access|
|**D**|- **BSL** management critical<br>- Cord terminates S1 at 28 weeks|- **BSL** management critical <br>- Cord terminates at L3 at term|- **Separation anxiety**<br>- Cord terminates at L2/3 at 1 year|
|**E**|- **Temperature** management critical|- **Temperature** management critical|
|**Other**|- **Why are they premature?** Foetal/maternal|
|**Requirements**|- NICU<br>- Neonatologist|- NICU|- Anaesthetic assistant capable of cannulating and ventilating|

####Changes in Infants in Detail
**Airway Differences:**
* Relatively large:
	* Head
	* Tongue
		* Difficult to negotiate with laryngoscopy
		* ↑ Risk of upper airway obstruction
		* Obligate nasal breathing in first few weeks of life  
			* ↑ Risk of obstruction with:
				* Nasal congestion
				* Foreign body
					* Nasal prongs
					* NGT
	* Epiglottis  
	May cover laryngeal inlet if laryngoscope is engaged in the vallecula - hence use of straight blades to elevate epiglottis.
* Relatively small mandible
* Prominent occiput
* Short neck and trachea
	* High risk of both endobronchial intubation and inadvertent extubation  
	Endobronchial intubation may be eithe left- or right-sided, as both main bronchi divert at the same angle.
* Higher larynx  
Results in relatively **anterior larynx**.


**Respiratory Differences:**
* ↑ VA:FRC ratio  
Change in inspired gas mixture rapidly alters alveolar (and arterial) gas composition.
	* Rapid uptake of volatile agents
* Higher closing volume (until 6-12 months) and reduced FRC  
	* ↑ Risk of atelectasis
	* ↑ Risk of shunt
	* Rapid desaturation 
* Immature respiratory centres
	* Periodic breathing with apnoeas in neonates
	* Sub-anaesthetic drug concentrations still affect respiration
* Anatomically inefficient alignment of thoracic bones, and weak respiratory musculature
	* Less efficient ventilation  
	Reliant on diaphragm as bucket-handle mechanism not functional.
	* ↓ Respiratory reserve
	* Earlier onset of respiratory failure due to fatigue
	* ↑ Chest wall compliance  
	Early appearance of intercostal and sternal recession when work of breathing is ↑.
* ↓ Number of thick-walled alveoli  
May only be 10% of adult total.


**Cardiac Differences:**
* ↓ Myocardial compliance  
Heart failure with ↑ volume due to poor Starling response.
* ↓ Contractility  
Due to ↓ number of elements.
	* Fixed stroke volume
	* CO is HR dependent
* Heart rate
	* Bradycardia is poorly tolerated  
	HR <60 does not give adequate CO - **commence CPR** in neonates, or when there are signs of inadequate perfusion in older children.
		* Atropine  
		Relative parasympathetic predominance in autonomically stressed child, but not always reliable.
		* Adrenaline  
		Better choice when bradycardia must be corrected immediately and reliably (which is usually the case).
			* Consider ~1μg/kg adrenaline for bradycardia in non-arrest situations  
			0.1ml/kg of 1:10,000 adrenaline, diluted into a 10ml syringe, will give 1μg/kg/ml.
	* Tachycardia is well tolerated
* Dominate vagal tone  
Bradycardia common with vagal stimuli, such as laryngoscopy, hypoxia.


**CNS Differences:**
* Incomplete blood-brain barrier  
Free passage of:
	* Opioids
	* Barbiturates
	* Bilirubin
* Open sutures and large anterior fontanelle
	* Can be used to evaluate presence of ↑ ICP
	* Sutures will open and fontanelle expand prior to ↑ in ICP
* Greater volume of CSF
	* Subarachnoid anaesthesia requires higher doses, and does not last as long
* Spinal cord occupies entire length of canal  
Canal and cord grow at different rates, so the termination moves cephalad with age:
* Incomplete ossification of sacral vertebrae  
Neuraxial techniques achievable.


**MSK Differences:**
* Sensitivity to **hypothermia** due to:
	* ↑ Surface area:volume ratio  
	↑ Heat losses to environment, and in respiratory vapour (due to higher MV).
	* ↓ Heat production  
	Weaker compensatory mechanisms:
		* Ineffective shivering
		* Poor vasoconstriction  
		Ineffective A-V shunts.
		* Non-shivering thermogenesis  
		Brown fat metabolism key to heat production.

**Renal Differences:**
* ↓ Tubular concentrating ability
* ↓ Renal bicarbonate levels
* ↓ GFR  
Reduced ability to cope with volume and electrolyte loads.


**Hepatic Differences:**
* Neonate
	* Reduced vitamin K dependent clotting factors in neonate
	* Reduced glucose storage in neonate
		* Hypoglycaemia common if not feeding
* Infants  
Up to 2-3 months:
	* Immature metabolic pathways
		* Many drugs  
		May prolong post-operative effects, and alter dosage intervals or infusion rates.
		* Bilirubin

**Pharmacological Differences:**
* Major differences occur in children up to ~6 months
* Absorption
	* Reduced IM and SC absorption
* Distribution  
	* Rapid distribution due to high CO
	* ↑ TBW and V<sub>d</sub> of water-soluble drugs
	* ↑ ECF compartment volume  
	Increases required dosing for drugs distributed to ECF.
	* ↓ Plasma protein level and protein binding  
	Increases free drug fraction.
	* Poorly developed blood-brain barrier  
	↑ CNS distribution of drugs. 
* Metabolism
	* Immature hepatic metabolism
* Elimination
	* Immature renal function



###Young Children
2-4 year old children:
* Have interactions with adults other than parents  
* Recognise *something is up* when in hospital, and will be generally suspicious
	* Usually cannot be approached with a needle without significant distress
	* May benefit from premedication  
	Difficult to predict which children will require premedication.
		* ~50% of children who are predicted to be well behaved will not be
		* ~50% of children who are given a premedication will still be difficult to manage
	* **Tone of language** is important

|System|2-4 Year Olds|
|---|---|
|**A**|- Laryngospasm|
|**B**|- Frequent URTIs<br>- Asthma common<br>|
|**C**|- Assess METs with climbing, crying, and fighting with siblings|
|**D**|- Parental involvement helpful for child anxiety|


###Primary School-Aged Children
5-10 year old children:
* Physiology is more similar to adults
* Primary issue is psychological
	* Word choice is crucial  
	Avoid:
		* Needle
		* Mash
		* Pain
		* Separation (from parent)
		* Vomit
		* Nausea
		* Sick
	* Distraction and hyponosis are beneficial
	* In general, believe that the world is fair and adults Do The Right Thing  
	Play to this.
	* Ideally, use onve voice during induction  
	Yours or the parents; but avoid chattering.

|System|5-10 Year Olds|
|---|---|
|**A**|- Loose teeth|
|**B**|- Frequent URTIs<br>- Asthma<br>- Respiratory management |
|**C**|- Assess METs with climbing, crying, and fighting with siblings|
|**D**|- **Choose words carefully**<br>- Distractible<br>- Cord terminates at L1/2 at 8|


###Secondary School-Aged Children
11-18 year old children:
* Physiology and management almost identical to adults
* Psychological differences remain the major difference  
Tend to respond in two ways to the stress of hospital and disease. Consult should be tailored appropriately.
	* Child-like response  
		* Frustrated, angry, "unfair"
		* Need gentle reasurrance
	* Adult-like response
		* Existential fears, uncertainty
		* Honest but fair discussion

|System|5-10 Year Olds|
|---|---|
|**A**|- Nil|
|**B**|- Nil|
|**C**|- Nil|
|**D**|- Tailor discussion to psychological state|		

##Particular Considerations
###Apnoea of Prematurity


###Perioperative Respiratory Complications
Perioperative respiratory complications:
* Are major causes of morbidity and mortality
* Major perioperative concerns - have a plan to manage: 
	* Laryngospasm
	* Bronchospasm
	* Atelectasis
* Can be reduced by identifying at-risk patients  
Factors include:
	* Patient factors:
		* Age  
		Risk decreases by ~11% per year of age.
		* ↑ Airway reactivity
			* Atopy
				* **Asthma**  
				Major risk factor.
				* Eczema
				* **FHx** of two or more relatives with asthma, eczema, or rhinitis
			* Eczema
			* Recent URTI  
			Within last 6/52, though first 2/52 are highest risk period.
				* **Croup** is especially high risk
			* Passive smoke exposure
		* Fever ⩾38°C.
	* Anaesthetic factors:
		* Premedication with midazolam
		* Use of volatiles:
			* Bronchospasm: Desflurane > Sevoflurane > Isoflurane
			* Sevoflurane associated with more laryngospasm than propofol maintenance (but equivalent bronchospasm)   
		Compared with sevoflurane.
		* Use of lignocaine
		* Airway devices and depth of anaesthesia  
		Safest options to reduce laryngospasm include:
			* Use of facemask  
			Equivalent bronchospasm risk to LMA, but significantly reduced laryngospasm.
			* Awake removal of ETT
			* Deep removal of LMA
			* Use of cuffed (compared with uncuffed) ETT  
			Also reduces post-operative stridor. 


####Post-Extubation Stridor/"Croup"{#stridor}
Post-operative laryngeal oedema due to irritation from ETT. It:
* Can be **disastrous**
* Occurs in young children due to airway diameter
	* 1-4 years
	* Infants ⩽1 at particular risk
* Presents as stridor and coughing
* Requires immediate treatment with:
	* Humidified oxygen  
	FiO<sub>2</sub> >0.5.
	* Resuscitation
	* Light sedation  
	Aim to reduce distress without decreasing respiratory drive.
	* Nebulised adrenaline  
	0.5ml/kg of 1:1,000, up to 5mg total.
	* Steroids  
	Dexamethasone 0.5-1mg/kg.
	* Reintubation  
	If ongoing deterioration or hypoxia
.	* Tracheostomy  
	If upper airway obstruction worsens.
* Rebound may occur at ~2 hours



###Reducing Intraoperative Heat Loss
Reduce:
* Unncessary exposure

Increase warming with:
* Radiant heaters
* Warm fluids
	* Intravenous
	* Irrigation
	* Skin preparation
* Active warmers
* Adjust operating theatre temperature
	* 20-22°C for children
	* 26-28°C for neonates
* Humidified ventilators
	* Circle system with HME
	* Inspiratory humidifiers
