#Post-Operative Apnoea

Post-operative apnoea:
* Describes recurrent periods of apnoea, with or without bradycardia
* Is a serious anaesthetic complication
* May occur in neonates, particular preterm infants with a **PCA ⩽ 60 weeks**


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
At-risk infants include:
* Premature
* Multiple congenital abnormalities
* Previous apnoea
* Chronic lung disease
* Bradycardia
* Anaemic ⩽100g/L
* Neurological disease

##Pathophysiology
Multifactorial, but believed to be the combination of:
* Prematurity
Strong association.
	* Elevated risk if PCA ⩽60
	* ⩽1% risk if PCA ⩽56
	* Highly significant if ⩽52. 
* Immature respiratory centre
	* Impaired response to:
		* ↓ PO<sub>2</sub>
		* ↑ PCO<sub>2</sub>
* Hypothermia
* Anaemia
* Respiratory muscle fatigue


##Assessment
Occurrence of apnoea is:
* Most common in first 4-6 hours post-operatively
* Possible up to 12 hours


##Management
Avoid outpatient surgery for any child who has:
* Apnoeas
* A history of apnoeas
* Anaemic

Inpatient admission:
* Requirement varies depending on hospital
* Multiple approaches exist
* Monitored observation includes:
	* Continuous SpO<sub>2</sub>
	* Line of sight nursing  
	* A plan to stimulate the child to resume respiration
* Conservative:
	* Admitting all infants <60 weeks for 24 hours of monitored observation
	* Admit and monitor all infants for 12 hours after surgery
* Tiered:
	* Otherwise well infants can be monitored for 6 hours post-operatively
	* Infants with apnoeas, lung disease, neurological disease, or anaemia should be monitored for 12 hours
	* Former pre-term infants should be referred to a specialist paediatric centre

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* D
	* Use of regional anaesthesia  
	May reduce risk.
