#Principles of Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery

>* ENT surgery has the anaesthetist and surgeon sharing the airway  
>Anaesthetic management has to adapt to surgical concerns.
>* 40% of difficult airway cases in NAP4 were ENT

General principles for anaesthesia for ENT surgery requires:
* Appreciating the **shared** and **remote airway**
	* Limited access
	* Casual surgical vandalism
		* Dislodgement
		* Eyes
		* Lips
		* Teeth
* Anaesthetic technique
	* Tube
		* ETT
		* MLT
		* Laser-resistant
	* Intermittent ventilation
		* e.g. LMA, oxygenate, remove LMA, procedure, desaturate, replace LMA, repeat
	* Tubeless  
		* HFNO
		* **Fire risk**
		* May be:
			* Apnoeic  
			* Spontaneously ventilating  
				* Propofol infusion and HFNO
				* Technically difficult to achieve
				* Hypercapnoea will occur and may be problematic in long cases
				* Avoid in:
					* Hypertensive patients
					* Obese patients
					* Unwell patients
	* [Jet ventilation](/anaesthesia/ent/jet-vent.md)
		* Supraglottic  
			* Risk of missing larynx and hypoxia
		* Infraglottic  
			* Increased risk of barotrauma
			* Reduced cord movement
		* Transtracheal
	* **Awake tracheostomy**  
		* Consider for:
			* Critical upper airway obstruction  
			Consider under LA.
			* Predicted difficult intubation
			* Failed intubation
			* Predicted difficult extubation
			* Failed extubation
			* Often time critical
		* Assess investigations and imaging
		* Second pair of hands
			* ENT surgeon
		* **Maintain** spontaneous respiration
* Use of **throat packs**
* Good **analgesia** plan  
Surgery may often be highly stimulating intraoperatively, but post-operative pain may be minimal.
	* High dose fentanyl for major ENT surgery
	* Remifentanil for procedures with low post-operative pain  
	0.5-1μg/kg load, and infusion at 0.1-0.3μg/kg/min.
* **Smooth emergence**  
Straining or coughing during emergence can increase bleeding, disrupt repairs, or dislodge grafts.
	* Deep extubation if appropriate
	* Exchange to LMA
	* Remifentanil at 0.1μg/kg/min until extubation
* Careful **preoperative assessment**
	* History
		* Vocal changes  
		Suggests a glottic lesion.
		* Stridor  
		Highly significant.
		* Dyspnoea  
		Supine dyspnoea concerning for >50% laryngeal obstruction.
		* Pain
			* Ear  
			Suggests supraglottic.
		* Dysphagia  
		Suggests increased size.
	* Examination
	* Investigations
		* Nasoendoscopy
		* CXR
		* CT/MRI
		* Ultrasound
		* ABG
		* LFTs



##Laryngeal Surgery
Anaesthesia for laryngeal lesions requires **understanding the pathology**, as this determines:
* Surgical approach and technique  
This dictates the:
	* Potential options for **anaesthetic** and **airway management**  
	* Surgical requirements
		* Laser  
		See [laser safety](/anaesthesia/considerations/laser-safety.md).
		* Head motion/position
		* Use of **nerve monitoring**  
		Requires avoidance of muscle relaxation.
		* Airway access  
		Often airway is inaccessible during surgery.
* Likelihood of difficult airway  
Airway compromise is common in these patients.


###Glottic Lesions
* Location
	* Anterior  
	Usually amenable to **MLT**/ETT if tracheal inspection not required.
	* Posterior  
	Not amenable to ETT, requires either **jet** or **apnoeic** (tubeless) oxygenation.
* Type of pathology
	* Papilloma
		* Laser
		* Usually requires surgeon to inspect the entire bronchial tree
* Surgical technique
* State of airway on completion of surgery  
Often worse:
	* Blood
	* Oedema


###Subglottic Lesion
* Location
	* Amenability to **tracheostomy**
	* Extent of lesion
* Airway usually improved on completion of surgery


###Supraglottic Lesion
* Often straightforward larynx but view impeded by pathology  
Often need some **alternative device**:
	* VL
	* FOI
	* Awake tracheostomy
* Imaging
* Nasoendoscopy
* Method of surgical treatment
* State of airway on completion of surgery


###Nasal Surgery
Topical vasoconstrictors:
* May precipitate profound hypertension  
Beware **ischaemic heart disease**.
	* Best managed with short-acting vasodilators
	* Consider short acting β-blockers (e.g. esmolol) in patients already β-blockaded
* Cocaine  
Less commonly used. Up to 2mg/kg.
* Adrenaline  
Commonly used. Dose will depend on current haemodynamics.


Bloodless surgical field:
* Particularly important for nasal surgery as this allows easier identification of anatomy and expedites the procedure
* Aim:
	* 5-10° head up
	* Avoid hypercarbia
	* Hypotensive anaesthesia  
	Combination of lower SBP and HR ~60.
		* Remifentanil TCI 3-4ng/mL usually excellent option for all of the above
		* Consider adding esmolol, hydralazine, clonidine if unable to achieve this despite higher remifentanil use


Nasal obstruction:
* May be difficult o mask ventilate with a closed mouth in this patient population due to the nature of the surgery  
OPA is helpful.


Airway:
* Restricted access
* Decide between oral RAE or flexible LMA depending on aspiration risk and comfort level with limited access
* A well-fitting LMA will pool blood above and offer good protection to the airway
	* Leak can be managed with switching to an alternate size or packing the mouth with a throat pack  
	Leak will cause bubbles in the surgical field and be disruptive.


Analgesia:
* Usually minimal analgesia requirements post-procedure

###Ear Surgery
* Avoidance of nitrous  
Usually contraindicated to prevent distension of the middle ear, but may (at times) be requested by the ENT surgeon.
