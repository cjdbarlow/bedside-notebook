# Standard Approach

This section outlines the chemical principles underlying blood gas interpretation and provides a reasonably standard approach.

## Principles

### Anion Gap

The $Anion \ Gap = Na^+ - Cl^+ - HCO_3^-$:

* **Normal** is **12** (8-16)\
A value rather than range is specified to permit further calculations.
* Low sensitivity and specificity\
* Accuracy falls further in the setting of hypoalbuminaemia, and so should be corrected:
	* $AGc = AG + 0.25 \times (40 - [albumin])$
	* i.e. For every 4 g/L ↓ (or ↑) in serum albumin, the normal anion gap ↓ (or ↑) by 1
* The anion gap rises when anions other than bicarbonate contribute to negative charge
	* In an inorganic acidosis, chloride ↑ and bicarbonate ↓ proportionally such that the AG remains normal
	* Other acid anions produce an H^+^ that reacts with HCO~3~^-^ and the bicarbonate ↓, and the AG ↑

:::column-margin
The Anion Gap is sometimes written including potassium. This makes the:

* $Anion \ Gap = Na^+ + K^+ - Cl^+ - HCO_3$
* Equation marginally more accurate\
Predominantly in patients who experience wild swings in their serum potassium, typically renal patients.
* Maths marginally harder
* Normal value 16 (12-20)
* CICM examiner sad\
Thus, the uncorrected version is used here.

* Erroneous measurements
	* Measurement error of each of the composite electrolytes
	* Effect of other substances
		* Chloride impersonators\
		Halides, such as bromide and iodide.
		* Unmeasured cations\
		Lithium, calcium, magnesium.
		* Cationic drugs
		* Protein\
		Anionic proteins will ↑ the AG whilst not causing significant acidosis:
			* Gamma-globulinaemia
			* ↑ Serum paraprotein
			* ↑ Phosphate
			* ↑ Sulfate


### Delta Ratio

The $Delta \ Ratio = {\uparrow AG \over \downarrow HCO_3^-}$:

* **Relates the change in the AG to** the **change in** the **bicarbonate**
* If the ↑ in AG is matched by the ↓ in HCO~3~^-^, then bicarbonate has theoretically buffered the entire acid load\
This relies on several assumptions that do not occur in practice:
	* Bicarbonate is not the only extracellular buffer
	* ~50% of metabolic acidosis is buffered intracellularly
	* Measurement error exists in measuring the five components of the ratio\
	Sodium, potassium, chloride, albumin, bicarbonate.

: Interpretation of the Delta Ratio

+---------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Ratio   | Interpretation                                        |
+=========+=======================================================+
| <0.4    | NAGMA                                                 |
+---------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 0.4-0.8 | Mixed HAGMA and NAGMA                                 |
+---------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 0.9-1.2 | Pure HAGMA                                            |
+---------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| \>1.2   | HAGMA with pre-existing metabolic alkalosis\          |
|         | An ↑ DR indicates an ↑ degree of metabolic alkalosis. |
+---------+-------------------------------------------------------+


### Standardised Base Excess

* The base excess is the **amount of strong acid or base** that would have to be **added to** a sample of ***whole* blood to produce** a **pH** of **7.4 at** a **PaCO~2~** of **40mmHg** at **37°C**\
This quantifies the metabolic portion of an acid-base disturbance.
* The ***standardised* base excess** is the **base excess normalised to** a **haemoglobin** of **48g/L**\
This **generalises** the **result to** the **extracellular fluid compartment** by attenuating the buffering effect of haemoglobin


### Osmolar Gap

The $Osmolar \ Gap = Osm_{measured} - (2 \times Na^+ + Urea + Glucose)$:

* Difference between:
	* Total (measured) osmoles
	* *Measurable* osmoles
* Normal <10\
Should be ~6.
* An ↑ OG with a normal AG occurs with any substance that does not dissociate at physiological pH\
This may occur in absence of acidosis if the osmole is not metabolised to produce an acid. 

:::column-margin
* Osmolality relates only to concentration, and is unrelated to molecular size or weight
* To affect the OG, osmoles must be present in a sufficient concentration to make a meaningful contribution to total osmolality
:::

* Osmoles that are metabolised to unmeasured anions will also ↑ the AG as they are metabolised, causing a concurrent ↓ in the OG\
This occurs during metabolism of toxic alcohols.
* The reverse happens late in DKA resuscitation, where regeneration of NAD^+^ causes a greater production of acetoacetate from ketones, part of which spontaneously dissociates to form acetone which ↑ the osmolar gap

### Strong Ion Difference

* Net charge of substances that remain fully ionised at physiological pH

:::column-margin
The normal strong ion difference is +42meql/L, and the full list contains:

* Cations
	* Sodium
	* Potassium
	* calcium
	* Magnesium
* Anions
	* Chloride
	* Lactate
	* Acetoacetate
	* β-hydroxybutyrate
:::

### Urinary Anion Gap

$AG_{urine} = Na^+ + K^+ - Cl^-$:

* Ammonium is the major adjustable urinary cation, and so the urinary AG acts as an index of NH~4~^+^ excretion\
* Indicates whether a NAGMA is due to renal or non-renal cause\
This is usually (but not always) obvious clinically.
* If the urinary AG is:
	* Negative then chloride exceeds the measured cations\
	NH~4~^+^ is being eliminated which is an appropriate renal response to acidosis. The problem lies elsewhere.
	* Positive then there is inappropriate chloride retention/loss of base


Derivation of the urinary anion gap equation:

* Urine normally contains:
	* Cations\
	Sodium, potassium, ammonium (NH~4~^+^), calcium, magnesium.
	* Anions\
	Chloride, bicarbonate, sulphate, phosphate, organic anions.
* Sodium, potassium, and chloride are the only commonly measured ions, the rest are unmeasured
* Total anion change must equal total cation charge:\
$Cl^- + Unmeasured_{anions} = Na^+ + K^+ + Unmeasured_{cations}$
* Therefore:\
$AG_{urine} = Unmeasured_{anions} - Unmeasured_{cations} = Na^+ + K^+ - Cl^-$


## Approach

:::tick
Although not part of acid-base assessment, now is a good time to determine any abnormalities of gas exchange:

1. Determine **PAO~2~** using the **AGE**\
$PAO_2 = FiO_2 \times (P_{atm} - 47) - {PaCO_2 \over R}$
	* Normal A-a gradient is $10mmHg + 0.1 \times Age$
	* The A-a gradient can be expected to increase by 5-7mmHg for every 10% ↑ in FiO~2~
	* An ↑ A-a gradient indicates ↓ PaO~2~ is secondary to shunt or diffusion limitation, rather than alveolar hypoventilation or ↓ FiO~2~
2. Determine **P/F ratio**	
:::

:::column-margin
The A-a gradient is not actually that helpful in practice, since shunt is almost always the primary cause.
:::

:::column-margin
Assuming standard atmospheric pressure an a normal respiratory quotient, the AGE can be abbreviated to: $PAO_2 = FiO_2 \times 713 - PaCO_2 \times 1.25$
:::

This details a reasonably standard approach to blood gas interpretation:

1. **Determine** the **primary process**\
Is it metabolic or respiratory?
	* Evaluate pH and PaCO~2~

:::column-margin
If both pH and PaCO~2~ are normal then a dual metabolic problem is possible.
:::

2. **Determine compensation**
	* Metabolic compensation for respiratory disorder
		* Full compensation may occur:
			* For PaCO~2~ between 25-80mmHg
			* Over ~5 days
		* Some compensation is evident with an appropriate change in the SBE
	* Respiratory compensation for metabolic disorder
		* Full compensation does not occur
		* PaCO~2~ in mmHg should ≃ the last 2 digits of pH (after the decimal point)\
		This rule of thumb is invalid in severe acidosis or dual disorders.

:::column-margin
Compensation rules are messy in practice - the overlapping, dynamic effect of both disease and treatment means patients rarely behave as expected.
:::

:::column-margin
: Metabolic Compensation Rules

+---------+-----------+-----+
| Acute   | Acidosis  | ↑ 1 |
+---------+-----------+-----+
| Acute   | Alkalosis | ↓ 2 |
+---------+-----------+-----+
| Chronic | Acidosis  | ↑ 4 |
+---------+-----------+-----+
| Chronic | Alkalosis | ↓ 5 |
+---------+-----------+-----+
| Indicates the change in   |
| HCO~3~^-^ in mmol/L for   |
| every 10mmHg change in    |
| PaCO~2~                   |
+---------------------------+
:::

:::column-margin
: Respiratory Compensation Rules

+-----------+--------------------------------------+
| Acidosis  | $PaCO_2 = (1.5 \times HCO_3^-) + 8$  |
+-----------+--------------------------------------+
| Alkalosis | $PaCO_2 = (0.7 \times HCO_3^-) + 20$ |
+-----------+--------------------------------------+
:::

3. **Determine severity**
	* Metabolic disorders
		* Mild: SBE 4-9
		* Moderate: SBE 10-14
		* Severe: SBE >14

:::column-margin
The SBE determines severity in both directions; i.e. an SBE of 12 is moderate alkalosis, an SBE of -12 is moderate acidosis.
:::

4. **Determine contributors**
	* **Contribution** of **unmeasured anions** to acidosis\
	Unmeasured anions will ↑ the anion gap.
		* Calculate albumin-corrected AG.
			* If ↑, look for unmeasured anions
			* If low or negative, consider:
				* Laboratory error
				* Lithium
				* IgG myeloma
		* If ↑ AG, are unmeasured anions the only cause?\
		Two approaches:
			1. Calculate the Delta Ratio
			2. Determine if the AG changed proportionally to the SBE:
				* Calculate the change in AG (ΔAG)
				* If $\Delta AG = SBE$ then a single metabolic disorder is present\
				The change in SBE is explained entirely by the AG.
				* If $\Delta AG \neq SBE$ then a NAGMA is also present
	* **Contribution** of **osmoles**\
		* Calculate osmolar gap
	* **Contribution** of **renal acid handling**
		* Relevant in NAGMA
		* Calculate urinary anion gap

:::column-margin
Calculating the change in AG relative to SBE is conceptually similar to the Delta Ratio, with a Copenhagen flavour.
:::

:::column-margin
$\Delta AG = AG - 12^*$\
\
\*In the setting of abnormal albumin the alternative normal value should be used.
:::


### Examination

For the purposes of an exam:

* If the FiO~2~ is given, you should calculate the A-a gradient
* If there is a metabolic acidosis, you should calculate the AG
* If the AG is ↑, you should calculate the delta ratio
* If there is a measured osmolality, then you should calculate the osmolar gap\
\
* Urinary pH = RTA
* Polyuria post-TBI = Mannitol
* 'Young female' = Pregnancy
* Hyperglycaemia = DKA or HHS
* Flucloxacillin/paracetamol with renal or hepatic dysfunction = Pyroglutamic acidosis
* Hypercholesterolaemia = Myxoedema coma
* Osmolality = Toxic alcohols
