# Tracheostomy Weaning

:::tick
There are three key components of a trachestomy wean:

* **Comfort**\
The difficulty of the tracheostomy wean should be graded so that it is challenging, but achievable.
* **Progression**\
Gains made with the tracheostomy wean should be actively identified and celebrated. Stagnation should prompt a change in strategy.
* **Joy**\
This can be a long and depressing phase of an intensive care admission. Try and incorporate something fun each day.
:::

The pace of progression will vary depending on the the patient, but a fairly standard path involves:

:::column-margin
Depending on respiratory mechanics and individual preferences, different patients may fare better with CPAP, HFTM, or speaking valve.
:::

* Transition from controlled ventilation to pressure support ventilation
* Gradually ↓ pressure support and PEEP
	* ↑ RR is an earlier sign of failure than ↓ V~T~
	* Avoid over-tiring a patient, sustained steady progress is preferable to a rapid wean followed by exhaustion and stagnation
* Once comfortable on pressure support, introduce trials of:
	* CPAP\
	Generally 5-10cmH~2~O, without pressure support.
	* High-flow trache mask\
	Humidified oxygen.
	* Speaking valve\
	Requires cuff down, and therefore has associated aspiration risk.
* Progressively ↑ duration of trials and ↓ of support until the patient is consistently stable and comfortable on a non-CPAP mode of support
* Consider decannulation once above preconditions met

:::column-margin
Considerations for cuff down periods:

* ↑ Aspiration risk whilst cuff is down\
Positive pressure ventilation partially mitigates this by providing continual flow of air *out* via the larynx
* Aspirate secretions above the cuff prior to deflation
* Suction via the tracheostomy *during* deflation to catch dislodged cuff secretions
:::


### Failure to Wean

If progress is not being made, consider:

* Replacing with a fenestrated tracheostomy
	* ↑ Respiratory work
	* Permits vocalisation with cuff up
* Downsize tracheostomy\
↓ Size by 1 (e.g. 8.0 to 7.0) to ↓ degree of native airway obstruction produced by tracheostomy.
	* ↑ Ease of cuff-down periods
	* ↑ Resistance of breathing via tracheostomy
	* Cuff may be non-occlusive if under-sized, limiting positive pressure ventilation
* Refer to ENT team\
Other airway pathology that is impeding wean, e.g.
	* Paradoxical vocal cord movement
	* Granulation tissue
	* Stenosis


## Decannulation

A tracheostomy can be **removed safely if** a patient:

| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| ↑ Secretion clearance                      | ↑ Work of Breathing     |
| ↓ Secretion burden                         | ↑ Anatomical dead space |
| Facilitate speech                          |                         |
| Improved swallowing                        |                         |
| Better humidification                      |                         |
| Pursed lip breathing - provides auto-PEEP  |                         |
| ↓ Nursing/carer burden                     |                         |
| ↓ Tracheostomy risks (bleeding, infection) |                         |

* Has a **patent** upper **airway**
	* Indication for tracheostomy
	* Known difficulties with airway management
* Has a **protected** upper **airway**
	* Adequate conscious state
	* **Airway reflexes** intact\
	Cough and gag present.
	* Low **gastric aspirates**\
	Avoid commencing weaning in patients with gastric aspirates >250mL due to the risk of aspiration.
* Can **clear** their **secretion load**\
Cough adequate for the volume of secretions. Consider met if:
	* **<4 suction** episodes in previous **24 hours**
	* **No suppurative** lung disease
	* Adequate analgesia and strength
* Does **not require** mechanical **ventilation**
	* **>24 hours** free from assisted ventilation
	* **Minimal** additional **oxygenation**\
	* No upcoming requirement for mechanical ventilation
	* Adequate strength


### Approach

If preconditions are met:

* Perform a cuff-down trial\
Deflate the tracheostomy cuff.
* Ensure 48-72 hours without need for mechanical ventilation
* Remove tracheostomy tube and apply occlusive dressing\
It should **heal** over in **7-10 days**. If there is late failure, an existing tract can be reopened with serial dilators, or a smaller tracheostomy tube can be placed.

:::column-margin
One traditional approach to weaning was a **capping trial**, which:

* Involves **occluding** (capping) the **trache**ostomy
* Evaluates the patients ability to breathe via the native airway with with an upper airway obstruction provided by the blocked trache
* The patient should be 1:1 monitored during the first **15 minutes** of capping
* Duration of capping depends on where the tracheostomy wean is being conducted\
In a ward/lower-skilled environment, the cap should be tolerated for least **24** hours prior to removal. This can be expedited in an ICU setting.
* Is probably an unnecessary burden in the overwhelming majority of patients
:::


### Failure to Decannulate

If weaning is unsuccessful, consider:

* Long-term tracheostomy
* Vocal cord surgery\
For paralysis or dysfunction.
* NIV with capped tracheostomy
* Airway stenting\
For tracheomalacia.
