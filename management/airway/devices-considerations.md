##Intubation
Factors favouring intubation include


Patient:
* Weight ⩽ 10kg  
Relaxant not required.
* Age  
	* Resistance in cuffed tubes is significantly more than uncuffed tubes  
	As resistance is proportional to the radius<sup>4</sup>; this effect is dramatic in small tube sizes.
	* Consider using uncuffed tubes until ~5.0


* Nasal RAE tube start cuffed at 6.0  
Consider using a reinforced ETT instead.
