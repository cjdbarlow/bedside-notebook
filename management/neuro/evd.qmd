# External Ventricular Drain

An EVD is a catheter inserted via a burr hole into the right or left lateral ventricle, in order to:

* Drain CSF
* Measure ICP
* Administer medication

:::column-margin
EVDs are usually inserted:

* Anteriorly
* Into the non-dominant hemisphere

## Indications

Diagnostic and therapeutic:

## Contraindications

## Anatomy

## Equipment

The components of the EVD from proximal to distal are:

* **Multi-stage access catheter**\
Inserted into the ventricle.
* **Patient connection line**\
Connects the drain to the monitoring and drainage apparatus.
* **3-way stopcock**\
Allows line to be:
	* **Transduced**\
	A non-flushing pressure transducer should be used, so the line cannot be inadvertently flushed into the brain.
	* **Drained**\
	Note that the EVD **cannot simultaneously transduce** ICP **and drain** CSF. When draining, the ICP waveform should transduce the drainage height.
	* **Sampled**\
	Attaching a 3mL syringe allows aspiration of CSF for sampling. Routine sampling ↑ the risk of ventriculitis.
* **Drip chamber**\
A small chamber with volume markers. This chamber:
	* Can be adjusted relative to the pressure scale\
	This **allows** the **drainage height** (pressure) to be **selected**.
		* When ICP exceeds the drainage height, CSF will vent from the EVD
		* Standard drainage height is **10-15*cmH~2~O***\
		Many scales provide options for both mmHg and cmH~2~O. 
	* Collects CSF\
	Allows hourly volumes vented to be measured.
	* Can be periodically emptied into a drainage bag
* **Drainage bag**\
Collects CSF that is vented from the drip chamber.

:::column-margin
1mmHg is \~1.3cmH~2~O; 1cmH~2~O is \~0.7mmHg.

## Technique

### Setup and Maintenance

Position and set up:

* The pressure scale should be set at 0 relative to the:
	* EAM in a supine patient\
	This is level with the Foramen of Munro.
	* Bridge of nose in a lateral patient
* The EVD should be **clamped prior to moving** to prevent CSF over-draining\
This includes raising or lowering the bed, transport, physiotherapy, etc.
* The EVD should be re-leveled after each position change


Zeroing:

:::column-margin
:::priority
Do not remove the bung on the transducer - the zero should happen without the system opening to the atmosphere.
:::
:::

0. Check EVD is level with the tragus
1. Turn the 3-way tap off to patient\
This is the tap at the level of the transducer, such that the transducer is 'open to the drip chamber.'
2. Drop level of the drip chamber to 0
3. Zero pressure on monitor
4. Return trip chamber to desired height
5. Close 3-way tap to the transducer

### Therapeutic Use

The EVD will generally be set in one of two modes:

:::column-margin
Continuous drainage is used for hydrocephalus (and in SAH, to prevent hydrocephalus); intermittent venting is used in TBI.
:::

* **Continuous drainage**\
	* EVD is left open at a set height\
	CSF will passively drain when ICP > set height.
		* EVD 'weaning' may be performed by raising the set height - absence of CSF drainage indicates that ICP is not rising above this level
	* High-volume CSF drainage is >30mL/hr\
	Nursing notification should occur if EVD drainage is >20mL/hr.
	* The EVD is generally *not* transduced in these circumstances, although it is good practice is to transduce every hour to confirm patency if there has been no CSF drainage\
	A pressure transducer may not need to be attached if the EVD is being used in this way.
* **ICP monitoring/intermittent venting**\
	* Continuously transduced\
	Intermittently vented in case of ↑ ICP.

Other uses:

* **CSF sampling**\
CSF may be sampled from an EVD, generally to evaluate for the presence of ventriculitis.
* **Medication administration**\
Occasionally, medications (e.g. thrombolytics) are administered through an EVD.


### Troubleshooting

* **Blocked EVD**
	* EVDs can become blocked with blood or other exudate
	* Briefly lowering the EVD ('dropping to the floor') will detect blockage as CSF should flow under gravity when the EVD is lowered\
	This should be done only for a few seconds to confirm CSF flow, over-draining should be avoided to prevent collapse of the ventricles and intracranial haemorrhage. 
	* A blocked EVD *may* be flushed to restore patency, and should be done by the neurosurgeon.

## Complications

* I
	* Ventriculitis\
	Risk is ↑ with:
		* Non-sterile insertion
		* Duration of EVD insertion
		* SAH/IVH present
		* Skull fracture
		* Frequent CSF sampling
