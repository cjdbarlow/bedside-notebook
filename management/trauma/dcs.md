#Damage Control Surgery and Resuscitation


Damage control surgery describes **limited surgical interventions** to correct or temporise **immediately life-threatening injuries until** a patient **regains** the **physiological reserve** to **tolerate** definitive **repair**. Effective damage control surgery requires:
* Early patient selection
* Abbreviated life-saving surgery
	* Normalise physiology at the expensive of anatomy
	* May result in early amputation of abbreviated surgery leading to neurovascular deficit, in order to save life




##Indications
Severely injured patients with multisystem trauma, generally indicated by:
* Severe physiological derangement	
	* Hypothermia
	* Coagulopathy
		* Clinical  
		No visible clots or diffuse tissue ooze.
		* Laboratory  
		APTT/PT >1.5x normal.
	* Persistent cellular shock
		* pH <7.2
		* BD >15mmol/L
		* lactate >5mmol/L
		* O<sub>2</sub> consumption index <100ml/ml/m<sup>2</sup>
		* New ventricular arrhythmia
* Inability to control bleeding
* Large volume resuscitation
	* >10 units PRBC
	* >12L of volume resuscitation  
	Including crystalloid and blood, in both pre- and intra-hospital phases.
* Injury patterns
	* Major venous injury with poor access  
	Intrahepatic, retrohepatic, retroperitoneal, pelvic.
	* Major liver injury  
	* Pancreato-duodenal injury with:
		* Haemodynamic instability
		* Head of pancreas bleeding
	* Massive vascular disruption to:
		* Duodenum
		* Pancreas
		* Pancreato-duodenal complex  
		With ampulla/pancreatic duct injury.
	* Requirement for staged abdominal or thoracic wall reconstruction



##Phases of Care
Damage control surgery can be divided into **five phases**:
* Pre-surgery damage control
* Damage control surgery  
* ICU resuscitation
* Definitive repair
* Reconstructive surgery



###Pre-surgery Damage Control
Prehospital:
* Perform life-saving maneuvers  
Necessity varies depending on:
	* Degree of injury
	* Transportation time
	* Provider skill
* Expedite transfer to definitive care


Emergency Department:
* Rapid assess extent of injury and physiological derangement
* Commence [damage control resuscitation](/management/trauma/dcr.md)



###Damage Control Surgery
> Operative time should be **⩽90 minutes** to avoid exacerbating physiological derangement.


Principles:
* Arrest haemorrhage
* Limit contamination
	* GIT injury
* Maintain flow to vital organs and extremities
	* Consider use of temporary shunts
* Avoid prolonged operating time, leading to further blood loss and physiological derangement


Methods:
* Damage control laparotomy
	* Open abdomen and pack all four quadrants  
		* Most significant bleeding packed first
		* Packs are then removed in reverse order, and bleeding and contamination in each quadrant is addressed in turn
	* Control haemorrhage
		* Resect severely damaged non-essential organs
		* Pack severely damaged essential organs
		* Ligate or shunt transected intraabdominal vessels
	* Control contamination  
		* Seal or resect perforated hollow viscera
		* Avoid reanastomosis
	* Temporary abdominal closure  
	Consideration of open abdomen to prevent abdominal compartment syndrome.
* Extremities
	* External fixation devices  
	Useful to avoid prolonged operative internal fixation or with contaminated wounds.
	* Vascular shunting  
	Temporary shunts to maintain flow, rather than ligation or definitive revascularization.
	* Fasciotomy



###ICU Resuscitation
> Goal is to normalise physiology


Methods:
* Continue fluid resuscitation
* Correct hypothermia
* Correct coagulopathy
* Obtain further imaging to define full extent of injuries




###Definitive Repair
> Usually begins 24-48 hours after initial injury

Definitive repair of previously temporised injuries, includign:
* Removal of packs
* Anastomosis or externalisation of discontinued bowel
* Removal of vascular shunts and definitive vascular repair
* Closure of abdominal and soft tissue defects



###Reconstructive Surgery

Surgery to restore premorbid form and function, e.g.:
* Cranioplasty
* Closure of large abdominal wall defects
