* Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC Score)
⩾3 factors suggests 85% likelihood of MTP.
	* HR ⩾120

	* Positive FAST scan
* Injury patterns
	* Uncontrolled:
		* Truncal bleeding
		* Junctional haemorrhage
		* Large soft tissue bleeding
	* Amputations
	* Mangled extremities
	* Clinical coagulopathy
	* Severe hypothermia
