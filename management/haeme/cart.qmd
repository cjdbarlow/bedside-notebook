# CAR T-cell Therapy

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy:

:::column-margin
This provides a brief overview of CAR T-cell therapy. Major complications of CAR T-cell therapy including CRS and ICANS are covered under @sec-haeme_cris and @sec-haeme_icans, respectively.
:::

* Involves administration of genetically-modified autologous T-cells to target a certain malignancy\
* Is a form of adoptive cellular therapy\
Practice of transferring autologous or allogenic immune cells to a patient, aiming to alter their immune environment to improve response to disease.


## Indications

Specific malignancies:

* Aggressive, refractory, or relapsed B-cell lymphoma
* Mantle cell lymphoma
* Multiple myeloma


## Contraindications

## Principles

Therapy involves:

* Apheresis of patients peripheral blood mononuclear cells
* Cryopreservation and transfer to a manufacturing facility
* Genetic modification of these cells to target a certain malignancy
	* Modification occurs with addition of the Chimeric Antigen Receptor gene to the cells, generally via a viral vector
	* Activation and clonal expansion of cells
* Cryopreservation and transfer back to treating institution\
Entire process takes ~6 weeks.
* Pre-treatment with lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy\
Improves subsequent T-cell expansion.
* Re-transfusion of the modified cells\
Generally via a central line to avoid extravasation.
* Clonal expansion of administered cells


:::column-margin
Genetic modifications are targeted at a particular receptor expressed by that cell. Consequently, all cells bearing this antigen will be targeted, which will include some non-malignant cells. This is known as 'on-target, off-tumour' toxicity.

## Practice


## Complications

Complications are common and may range from mild to life-threatening. They can be divided by time-course into:

:::column-margin
CRS and ICANS are covered under @sec-haeme_cris and @sec-haeme_icans, respectively.
:::

* **Acute toxicity**\
Occurs 0-30 days after therapy:
	* **Cytokine Release Syndrome**\
	Severe CRS also ↑ infective risk.
	* **Immune** Effector **Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome**
	* Infection
		* Febrile neutropenia
	* Anaphylaxis
	* Coagulopathy
	* Thromboembolism
	* Tumour Lysis Syndrome\
	Rare but remains a risk.
* **Delayed toxicity**
	* Hypogammaglobulinaemia
	* Cytopaenias

:::column-margin
Hypogammaglobulinaemia occurs due to destruction of B-cells relating to the CD-19 targeting CAR T-cells, which results in B-cell aplasia.
