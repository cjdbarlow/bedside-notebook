#Chronic Spinal Injury Management

*Covers management of spinal cord injuries after the first few weeks following injury. Management differs in the patient with an [acute spinal cord injury](/management/cns/acute-spine.md).*


Patients undergo a number of physiological changes following a spinal cord injury:

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
##Pathophysiology
###Aetiology
##Clinical Manifestations
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
Presence and severity of symptoms depends on height of injury.

* B
	* Pneumonia  
	Impaired expectoration.
	* Reduced TLC, FRC  
	Rapid desaturation with anaesthetic induction.
	* Assisted ventilation  
	Required by some patients.
* C
	* Coronary artery disease  
	3-10x increased prevalence, due to increased risk factors.
	* Atypical ischaemic symptoms
	* Hypovolaemia
	* Bradycardia  
	RHR of 50-60.  
* D
	* Chronic pain  
	Present in ~60%.
* E
	* Pressure area care  
	Pressure ulcers are common.
* H
	* Anaemia  
	Prevalent in ~50%>

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* A
	* Fusion may impair airway management
* C
	* Consider induction with vasopressor infusion
	* Arterial line
	* MAP within 20% of baseline
	* Pulmonary oedema with overfilling  
	Heart reliant on the Starling mechanism to increase cardiac output.
* D
	* Anaesthetic technique  
	Consider [autonomic dysreflexia](/management/cns/autonomic-dysreflexia.md).
	* Sensitivity to sedatives
* E
	* **Avoid suxamethonium**
