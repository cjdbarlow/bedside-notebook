#Cardiac Arrest Post-Cardiac Surgery

This section covers the algorithmic management of cardiac arrest in an adult patient who is:
* **Up to 14 days** after cardiac surgery
* And is typically:
	* In the ICU  
	* Invasively monitored

##Protocol
This algorithim assumes that the patient has ECG and invasive arterial monitoring:
* **Recognition**  
Arrest is consisent with:
	* Loss of central pulse
	* Loss of haemodynamic waveform pulsatility
		* Systemic arterial pressure
		* Pulmonary arterial pressure
		* CVP
		* Pulse oximetry
	* Loss of ETCO<sub>2</sub>
* **Assess rhythm**
	* **VF/VT/Tachycardia**
		* DC shock  
		Up to 3 attempts.
		* Start BLS  
		CPR *may* be delayed up to 1 minute to facilitate cardioversion.
		* Amiodarone  
		300mg. Further loading of 150mg followed by infusion may be given for refractory VT/VF.
		* Prepare for emergency resternotomy
	* **Aystole/Severe bradycardia**
		* Pace  
		In DDD or DOO at 100bpm and at maximal amplitude.  
		* Start BLS  
		CPR *may* be delayed up to 1 minute to facilitate cardioversion.
		* Consider external pacing
		* Prepare for emergency resternotomy
	* **PEA**
		* If paced, turn off external pacing to exclude underlying VF
		* Start BLS
		* Prepare for emergency resternotomy
* **Adjuvant management**
	* Airway  
		* Change to BVM with 100% O<sub>2</sub>
	* Breathing  
		* PEEP to 0cmH<sub>2</sub>O  
		Improve cardiac preload in the setting of tamponade/hypovolaemia.
			* Consider increasing PEEP if arrest secondary to hypoxia
		* Auscultate/ultrasound to evaluate for tension pneumo/haemothorax  
		Decompress if present.
	* Circulation
		* Avoid adrenaline unless advised by senior clinician  
		Typical dose is 50-300ug.
		* Give fluid bolus
		* Activate massive transfusion
		* Pause infusions  
			* Evaluate for dosing/drug errors
			* Consider restarting vasopressor infusions
		* Lignocaine 1mg/kg may be considered as an alternative to amiodarone
		* Change IABP settings:
			* Pressure trigger
			* Maximum augmentation
			* 1:1 ratio
		* Consider echocardiography  
		Use should not delay CPR or resternotomy.
* **Evaluate for reversible causes**


External Cardiac Compressions:
* Standard site, depth, and compression ratio
* An SBP of >60mmHg should be targeted if invasive arterial monitoring is present
* Inability to achieve an SBP of >60mmHg with compressions indicates need for **immediate resternotomy**  
Indication of arrest due to low preload (and not amenable to cardiac compressions) - tamponade or hypovolaemia are likely causes.


###Emergency Resternotomy

Emergency Resternotomy should be:
* Performed within 5 minutes of arrest  
Or immediately if SBP <60mmHg with external chest compressions.
* Considered in patients up to 14 days post surgery
* Prepared for immediately upon identification of cardiac arrest

Process:
* Cease chest compressions
* Remove sternotomy dressing, apply betadine, apply sterile drape  
Should be performed in \<10 seconds.
* Cut sternotomy incision and wires
	* Deep incision through sternotomy sutures down to sternal wires
	* Cut sternal wires
	* Remove sternal wires with heavy needle holder
* Suction blood and clot
* Open sternum with sternal retractor
* If no output despite opening sternum:
	* Consider internal defibrillation
	20J with internal paddles.
	* Commence internal cardiac massage
		* Avoid grafts
		* Right hand over apex and around behind the heart
		* Left hand over anterior surface of heart
		* Squeeze both hands together with flat palms and straight fingers  
		Aim SBP >60mmHg at a 100 bpm.

Post-procedural care:
* Transfer to OT
	* Washout
	* Consider closure
* Antibiotics
* Avoid fever  
Temperature \<36°C.
