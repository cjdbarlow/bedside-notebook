#Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy {#id}

##Indications
Indications for RRT include:
* Renal replacement  
Instituted when there is little to no residual kidney function.
* Life-threatening indications
	* Hyperkalaemia  
	RRT is effective in removing potassium, but requires frequent monitoring.
	* Acidaemia  
	Requires concomitant correction of the underlying disease.
	* Pulmonary oedema
	* Uraemic complications
* Non-emergent indications
	* Fluid overload
	* Solute control
* 


##Contraindications


##Equipment
Vascular dialysis catheter:
* Uncuffed, non-tunnelled catheter
* Preferentially sited in:
	* Right IJV
	* Femoral vin
	* Left IJV
	* Dominant SCV  
	Risk of central vein stenosis with SCV insertion.
	* Non-dominant SCV
* Positioned at the junction of the SCV and RA
	* Risk of atrial erosion if in too far
	* Risk of central vein stenosis if abutting SVC 

##Technique
Dialysis techniques include:
* Intermittent Haemodialysis (IHD)  
Rapid removal of volume and toxins.
* Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT)  
Slower, preferred in critically ill due to haemodynamic stability.
* Sustained Low-Efficiency Dialysis (SLED)  
Similar toxin control to CRRT, with potentially better acid-base control and HDx stability. Evidence is lacking to recommend SLED over CRRT.
* Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)


|Technique|Clinical Setting|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|--|--|
|IHD|- HDx stability<br>- Planned for continued dialysis in ward environment|- Rapid<br>- Cheaper|- Hypotension due to rapid volume shifts<br>- Increased complexity<br>- Cerebral oedema due to rapid fluid shifts|
|CRRT|- HDx instability<br>- High ICP|- Technically simple(r)<br>- HDx stability<br>- Continuous removal of toxins|- Slower clearance<br>- Prolonged anticoagulation/immobilisation<br>- Expensive|
|SLED|- HDx instability|- HDx stability<br>- Reduced anticoagulation requirement|- Slow clearance of toxins<br>- Increased technical complexity|
|PD|- HDx instability<br>- Coagulopathic<br>- Difficult access<br>- High ICP<br>- Austere setting|- Simple<br>- Cheap<br>- No anticoagulation requirement<br>- No vascular access requirement|- Reduced clearance in catabolic patients<br>- Protein loss<br>- No control over rate of fluid removal<br>- Risk of peritonitis<br>- Hyperglycaemia<br>- Respiratory impairment


###Anticoagulation

In general for CRRT:
*Anticoagulation is recommended when patient is:
	* Not coagulopathic
	* Not systemically anticoagulated
* Citrate is preferred if there is no contraindication
* UFH is used if citrate is contraindicated
* If there is an increased bleeding risk:
	* Use regional citrate/calcium in CRRT
	* Avoid regional UFH/LMWH  
	If citrate is contraindicated, then no anticoagulation should be used.
* For patients with contraindications to citrate and UFH:
	* Anticoagulation is still recommended
	* Direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban)  
	Contraindicated in hepatic failure.
	* Factor Xa inhibitors  
	Danaparoid, fondaparinux.


|Anticoagulant|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|--|--|---|
|Calcium/Citrate|- Regional anticoagulation reduces systemic haemorrhage<br>- Longer filter life<br>- Reduced transfusion and major bleeding compared to UFH|- Risk of overdose if set up incorrectly<br>- Citrate toxicity (especially hepatic failure, shock)<br> - More complex|
|UFH|- Widely available<br>- Familiar<br>- Short half-life<br>- Reversible<br>- Can be monitored<br>- Cheap<br>- Allows for regional anticoagulation with heparin/protamine combination|- Narrow TI<br>- Unpredictable kinetics<br>- HITS<br>- Heparin resistance|
|LMWH|- Predictable kinetics<br>- Does not require monitoring<br>- Less HITS|- May accumulate in renal failure<br>- Requires anti-Xa for monitoring<br>- Incompletely reversed with protamine<br>- More expensive|
