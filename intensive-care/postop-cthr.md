#Management of Post-Operative Cardiac Surgery
*This section covers the intensive care management common to post-op cardiac surgical patients*


Cardiac surgery is unique due to the:
* Type of procedure  
Common cardiac surgical procedures include:
	* Coronary Bypass Grafting
	* Valve repair/replacement
	* Aortic root repair/replacement
	* Repair of ASD/VSD
* Use of [Cardiopulmonary Bypass](/anaesthesia/cardiac/cpb.md)

	* PTHx
* Bloods
	* Hb
	* Platelets

		* K<sup>+</sup>
		* Mg<sup>2+</sup>
	* Glucose
	* Coagulation panel
	* Cardiac markers  
	Always elevated post-cardiac surgery, but are useful in trending changes.

##Management
###General Mangement
Common management of the cardiac patient includes:
* C
	* Remove PAC  
	Once HDx stable for 6 hours on minimal vasoactive suppport.
	* Remove other invasive lines  
	As able.
	* Isolate pacing wires  
	When no pacing requirement for 24 hours.
* D
	* Analgesia
	* Wean sedation  
	Short acting agents preferred.
* E
	* Warming  
	Should be rewarmed to >36°C. This:
		* Reduces arrythmia
		* Decreases SVR and myocardial work
		* Improves coagulopathy
* F
	* Remove IDC  
	Second post-operative day.

###Specific Medications
CABG surgery:
* Aspirin  
	* Within 6 hours
	* Consider clopidogrel if allergy
* Statin  
	* When PO intake resumes
* β-blockers
	* When able  
	Limited by pacing requirement, inotrope requirement, or hypotension.
* ACE-I/ARB
	* Consider in all patients
	* Limited by hypotension and AKI


###Haemodynamic Management
Haemodynamic impairment can be divided into problems with:
* Heart Rate/Rhythm
	* Tachycardias
		* Pacing malfunction
		* Electrolytes
		* AF
	* Bradycardia
		* Pacing malfunction
		* Electrolytes
		* Ischaemia
* Preload  
	* Hypovolaemia  
	Associated with lower filling pressures, and accentuated by diastolic dysfunction.
		* Bleeding
		* Diuretics
		* Rewarming
		* Vasodilators
	* ↑ Intrathoracic pressure
		* Pneumothorax
		* Excessive PEEP
	* ↑ Intrapericardial pressure
		* Tamponade  
		Elevation and equalisation of diastolic pressures.
	* RV failure
* Afterload/SVR 
	* ↑ **LV** afterload:
		*  Aortic valve dysfunction
		* Excessive vasoconstrictors
		* Dynamic outflow tract obstruction
	* ↓ LV afterload:
		* SIRS
		* Post-pump vasoplegia
		* Anaphylaxis
			* Protamine reactions
		* Excessive vasodilator therapy
		* Thyroid dysfunction
		* Adrenal insufficiency
	* ↑ RV afterload:
		* Acidosis
		* Hypoxia
		* Excessive PEEP
		* Thromboembolism
* Contractility
	* Ischaemia
		* Acute graft dysfunction
		* Air embolus  
		Predominantly RCA.

		* Myocardial stunning  
		Long bypass time.
		* Ventricular dilatation
		* Inadequate cardioplegia
	* Pre-existing ventricular dysfunction



##Complications after Cardiac Surgery
Complications of cardiac surgery relevant to intensive care include:
* **Bleeding**  
	* **Medical bleeding**  
	Due to abnormalities of coagulation.
		* Causes of medical bleeding:
			* **Platelets**
				* Qualitative abnormality  
				Platelet function is decreased by:
					* Preoperative use of antiplatelet agents
					* Cardiopulmonary bypass  
					Greater bypass duration is associated with greater impairment.
				* Quantitative abnormality  
				Low number of platelets.
			* Coagulation abnormality
				* Residual heparinisation
				* Haemodilution
				* Consumption
			* Fibrinogen  
				* Plasminogen is activated by CPB
		* Treatment of medical bleeding:
			* Normalise temperature
			* Prevent hypertension
			* Correct platelet dysfunction:
				* Platelet transfusion  
				Aim *functional* platelet count >100 × 10<sup>9</sup> in significant bleeding.
				* DDAVP  
				Aim to improve platelet function.
					* 20μg IV
			* Correct coagulopathy  
			Aim to normalise APTT and PT.
				* Typically 20ml/kg of FFP
			* Correct fibrinogen  
			Aim to keep fibrinogen >1g/L.
			* Prevent fibrinolysis  
			Consider in the setting of fibrinolysis (i.e. elevated D-Dimer and low fibrinogen).
				* TXA
			* Increase mediastinal pressure  
			Theoretically reduce venous bleeding.
				* Increase PEEP
				* Raise head of bed
	* **Surgical bleeding**  
	Due to uncontrolled (typically arterial) source. Suggested by:
		* Bleeding with normal coagulation parameters
		* Large volume drain outputs  
			* \>500ml in 1 hour
			* \>400ml/hr for 2 hours
			* \>300ml/hr for 3 horus
			* \>200ml/hr for 4 hours
		* Bleeding following period of extreme hypertension
* **Cardiac Tamponade**  
Collection of fluid (blood) around the heart, impairing filling and therefore CO.
	* Up to 5%
	* Clinical diagnosis
	* Features:
		* Tachycardia
		* Low UO
		* Fall in CO/SV/MVO<sub>2</sub>
		* Elevation and equalisation of diastolic pressures  
		RAP ≃ PADP ≃ PCWP.
			* May not occur if a small clot occurs around and impedes filing to only one chamber.
		* Loss of y-descent on CVP waveform  
		Indicates that the pressure gradient between the atria and the ventricles is reduced.
		* Loss of mediastinal drain output
		* Echocardiography
	* Treatment
		* Resternotomy and evacuation of clot
