The bulk of the content is a systemisation of the things I’ve learned:\n\nAt the bedside\nFrom wise clinician mentors\nFrom titans of critical care education, and from whom I have unrepentantly plagiarised, namely:\n\nCritical Care Compendium\nThe Internet Book of Critical Care\nDeranged Physiology"

Only in the case of HIE is imaging not required, and the diagnosis may be made on history alone.\nAbsence of physiological and anatomical confounders of assessment:\n\nNo high cervical spine injury\nMust be able to assess:\n\nUpper limb motor response to central stimulus\nCentral response (grimace) to upper limb stimulus\nCough reflex\n\nNormotensive\nSBP ≥90mmHg or MAP &gt;60mmHg in adults, or age-appropriate perfusion pressure in children.\nNo sedation, analgesia Time for assessment depends on the drugs used and the degree of renal or hepatic dysfunction.\n\nDrug antagonists can be used if concern about persisting effects\nThiopentone plasma levels should be &lt;10mg/L\n\nNo muscle relaxation\nConfirm with train-of-four.\nNormothermia\n≥ 36.5°C.

Consider using the second set of testing, as the family can be warned about any spinal reflexes that may occur.\nPrior to performing clinical testing, a minimum of 4 hours of observation should be performed during which the:\n\n\nThe observation period should be extended to 24 hours in the case of HIE or hypothermia &gt;6 hours.\n\nPreconditions are met\nGCS is 3\nNon-reactive pupils\nNo spontaneous respiratory effort\nAbsent cough reflex\n\n\n\nSince all patients undergoing brain death testing will be intubated, GCS 3 = GCS 2T.\nClinical testing is performed separately by two suitably trained and experienced clinicians (at least one a specialist), and requires:\n\nComa\nGCS 3; with no motor response following painful stimulus applied centrally and to all four limbs.\nAbsence of brainstem reflexes\nShould be tested sequentially and bilaterally.\n\nPupils\nFixed and non-reactive.\nCorneal reflex\nUse of cotton wool or gauze are appropriate stimuli.\nOculo-vestibular reflexes\nCold ice water injected into each EAM via a small catheter until either:\n\nNystagmus\nSlow-phase towards irrigated ear in intact brainstem.\nOcular deviation\n20mL given\n\nGag\nUse a tongue depressor or cotton swab. A laryngoscope can be used for assistance, if required.\nCough\n\nApnoea\nConducted last so that an ↑ PaCO2 does not confound assessment. Apnoea testing assesses ventilatory drive, and is performed by:\n\nPreoxygenation with 100% O2\nVentilator disconnection\nHypoxia (SpO2 &lt;88%) should be avoided; attach a self-inflating bag with a PEEP valve to prevent atelectasis and provide some passive entrainment.\nNo respiratory effort when:\n\nPaCO2 is ≥60mmHg, OR\nExpect PaCO2 to ↑ by ~3mmHg/min as a guide for when to perform the ABG.\nPaCO2 has risen 20mmHg above baseline\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of suction catheter or t-piece to provide passive oxygenation during apnoea testing is not recommended.\n\nFor patients on ECMO during apnoea testing:\n\nPreoxygenate via the lung and circuit\n↑ PaCO2 to &gt;45mmHg on the circuit\nAttach a CPAP circuit as describe above\n↓ Sweep to 0.5-1L/min\n\nThe time of death is the time of the second set of testing.

    "section": "Discussing Concepts",
    "text": "Discussing Concepts\n\nThis is a phrase library of concepts around transplant, organ donation, and the donation process.\n\n\nDonation\nOrgan Donation:\n\nPeople can donate organs if they pass away in very specific circumstances\nSometimes people register to do this while they are still alive, so that there is a record of it when they have passed\nOther times doctors will ask the family if they wish to donate\nIt is always a very hard time to think about such a serious thing, but this is the only time it can happen\nFamily don’t have to decide immediately and have some time to talk and think about it, but the decision does have to be made within a couple of days\nOrgans that can be donated include heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and pancreas\n\nTissue Donation:\n\nTissue donation is different to organ donation because almost anyone can become a tissue donor, irrespective of how they died\nTissues donation can occur some time after death and so is not as urgent\nTissues that can be donated include:\n\nCornea\nOuter layer of the eye used for those blinded from disease of their own cornea.\nHeart valves\nTo replace damaged heart valves.\nSkin\nUsed to replace skin in those with serious burns.\nBone\nTendons\nTo help repair damaged joints.\n\n\nOrgan Donation Process:\n\nBlood tests and sometimes x-rays or ultrasound is done to make sure the organs are healthy enough for transplant\nSometimes, the person will receive medicine to make sure the organs stay healthy enough to transplant\nThe organ will go to the next person on the waiting list who is a good fit\n\nYou can’t choose who the organs will go to\n\nThere’s a lot of organisation that has to happen before the organ donation goes ahead so it can take some time\nNeed to arrange:\n\nThe team who removes the organs\nThe patients who need the organs have to come into hospital\nThe teams who put in the organs into each patient\nThe transport for all of these\n\nThe donation operation:\n\nMay take up to 6 hours, depending on how many organs are being donated\nThe cut is closed up afterwards and covered with a special dressing\nThe body is then taken to the hospital mortuary\nThey will look different afterwards as their heart will have stopped beating\nThe family can see the body afterwards if they want to\nThere are no problems having an open-casket funeral after this operation\n\n\nAfter Organ Donation:\n\nThe family will get a call letting them know what was transplanted and how the recipients are doing\nThe family can’t contact the recipients directly, but can write to them through DonateLife\nThe recipients can also write to the family through DonateLife in the same way\n\n\n\nBrain Death\nOverview:\n\nThe brain is a soft and fragile organ that is protected in the skull\nThe brain keeps us alive by sending messages to all the other parts of the body to control them, and also lets us see, smell, hear, and think\nIf our brain very badly damaged then it can swell so much that blood can’t get to it\nThis can lead to death of the brain, even though the other parts of the body may not be as badly damaged\n\nBrain Death Testing:\n\nWe test for brain death through a formal process that tests the vital functions of the brain, such as coughing and breathing\nIf these tests confirm what we think is going on, then it means that the brain has died, and that means that they have died\n\nThey have died even though their heart continues to beat and the breathing machine keeps giving air\n\nYou are welcome to watch these tests\n\nSome people find it helpful to watch the testing\nOther people find it distressing\nIf you want to watch, someone will be with you to support you and tell you what is going on\n\nThe time of death is the the time that the second set of tests are done\nThey will look the same after this set of testing as they are still on the breathing machine\n\nDonation after brain death:\n\nIf they become an organ donor, they will look like this when they go to the operating room for the donation procedure\n\n\n\nCirculatory Death\nOverview:\n\nSometimes:\n\nThe brain is damaged very badly but some parts of the brain still work a little\nThis does not meet the criteria for brain death, but is still not a recoverable injury.\nThe person may be very sick and cannot survive without the breathing machine\n\nAt this point, we no longer think the breathing tube is helping them\nWe are not sure how long they will survive without the breathing tube, but we will focus on their comfort during this time\nThis usually happens within 10-20 minutes, but sometimes takes hours or days\n\nDonation after circulatory death:\n\nDonation can only happen if death occurs within a specific timeframe\n\nThis is so the possible damage to organs is minimised, which happens when they are without blood flow\n\nMedication will be given to relieve pain or distress\nPredicting time between withdrawal of support to death is hard\n\nOrgan donation may not be possible\nTissue donation may still occur\n\nYou can withdraw consent at any time\n\n\n\nTransplant\n\nWhen someones organs - body parts - are healthy, they can live a normal life\nWhen these organs get sick, then people are often very sick and it changes what they can do\nFor example:\n\nSomeone with sick kidneys may need to go on a machine called dialysis\nThis means they have to spend several hours at hospital 3 days a week\nThey are often very tired and can’t do much or work much even when they are not at hospital\nIf they get a healthy kidney put in, then they don’t need dialysis anymore and can get back to a more normal life"

    "text": "A Framework for Airway Management\n\nThere are many frameworks for airway management. This one aims to:\n\nFocus on a general plan but not on any specific technique\nProvide an approach that is appropriate for elective anaesthesia as well as emergency airway management\nPlan for and avoid the difficult airway\nIn the patient who does not require immediate intubation\n\n\n\nPlan\n\nEvaluate what techniques are available\nBased on the equipment, the patient, and technical skills. Think ACORNS:\n\nAwake\n\nWaking the patient\nAwake laryngoscopy\nAwake FOI\nIs there laryngeal or tracheal pathology?\n\nCricoid/FONA\n\nScalpel cricothyrotomy\nNeedle cricothyrotomy\n\nOral\n\nMask ventilation\nIntubation\nWith and without VL.\n\nNasal\nIs the oral route impossible?\n\nIntubation\nIncluding blind.\n\nSupraglotic\n\nUse of LMA\nUse of iLMA\n\n\nFor this patient, consider which techniques are:\n\nPreferred\nDepending on the indication for airway management. In most critical care situations (compared to elective anaesthesia), this will be a definitive oral airway.\nFeasible\nCould be used to maintain oxygenation +/- ventilation, but may not necessarily be definitive.\nUnfeasible\nCertain techniques may not be appropriate in certain patients.\n\nOf this short-list of options, decide on a hierarchy of techniques\nPlan for failure and have a series of identified rescue techniques, including a plan for:\n\nRescue ventilation\nAlternate device, e.g. LMA, iLMA.\nRescue intubation\nAlternate device.\n\nConsider which drugs will be required for these techniques\n\nPatient\nAdequate patient preparation prior to induction reduces incidence of difficult tracheal intubation. Think PROC:\n\n\nPositioning\n\n\nEnsure EAM is level with sternal notch to maximise ease of intubation\nRamping ↑ FRC in the obese patient\n\nRecruitment\nUse of CPAP during preoxygenation prolongs safe apnoea time in obese patients.\nOxygenate\nInvolves adequate denitrogenation, and consideration of apnoeic oxygenation.\n\nPreoxygenation/denitrogenation\nEtO2 &gt; 80% indicates a good proportion of FRC is oxygen, significantly prolonging safe apnoea times from 1-2 minutes up to 8 minutes.\n\nNote that reduced FRC (e.g. atelectasis) will lead to shunt and rapid drop in SpO2 despite a high ETO2 fraction\nSignificant shunt will result in an SpO2 of &lt; 100% despite adequate ETO2.\nThis can only be achieved when breathing oxygen through a closed-circuit system\n\nApnoeic oxygenation\nDelivery of oxygen via nasal cannula during the apnoeic period. This technique:\n\nRequires a patent airway\nMay not help during the apnoeic period when airway tone is reduced.\nMay be performed with:\n\nStandard nasal cannula from wall oxygen at 15L.min-1\nHumidified\n\nMay be useful when:\n\nFRC/ is compromised\nLaryngoscopy is difficult\n\n\n\n\n\nPerform\n\nComplete pre-airway management checklist\nDuring pre-oxygenation periods.\nBegin!\n\n\n\nAirway Management Mental Checklist\nA good mental checklist should be:\n\nEasy to remember\nAllows it to be used as a ‘challenge-confirm’ checklist - i.e. the steps can be performed by multiple providers simultaneously and then the checklist is used to verify tasks have been completed\nAppropriate to be used by a single provider as a ‘call-do-response’ checklist when working with an unfamiliar team\n\nThe SPEEDBOMB checklist:\n\n\nThere are many different checklists - I like this one. I routinely perform it during the pause that is provided during pre-oxygenation.\n\nSuction\n\nAvailable\nConsider gastric drainage if NGT is in situ\n\nPosition\nIn optimal position for this particular technique.\n\nEar-to-sternal notch\n\nEnd-tidal CO2\nAvailable and working.\nEquipment\nThe kit needed for the chosen techniques.\n\nBVM\nWith mask and PEEP valve.\nAirway adjuncts\nNPA and OPA available.\nLaryngoscope\n\nTwo working laryngoscopes\nLubricated\nCritically ill patients often have high sympathetic tone and a dry oropharynx, making advancement of an unlubricated blade down the tongue difficult.\nAppropriate sized blades\n\nLMA\nLubed and inflated as desired.\nETT\n\n\nOf appropriate size\nLubricated\nAt least two, including a smaller one\nIf concerned about upper airway pathology/burns, have a size 6 available\n\nAdjuncts to ETT\n\nBougie\nMust always be available.\nStylet\nSyringe\nFor cuff inflation.\n\n\nDrugs\nIncluding desired dose.\n\nInduction agents\n\nMuscle relaxant\nIf concerned, always use adequate doses of a rapid-onset NMBD.\nOpioid\nVasopressors\n\nBackup plan\nDouble check the availability of backup equipment, including FONA equipment.\nOxygen\n\nSupply present and connected\nEnsure that the oxygen tubing attached to the flowmeter is also attached to the patient.\nAdequate pre-oxygenation/denitrogenation period\nUse of PEEP for lung recruitment prior to induction\n\nMonitoring\n\nECG\nSpO2\nBP\n\nBriefing\n\nAllocate roles\nDetail airway plan A, B, etc\nDeclare at what points the airway management strategy will change\ne.g. “If the SpO2 falls to less than 93%, I will cease intubation attempts and return to BVM. If unable to mask ventilate, I will place an LMA.”"

If the tube is bitten, then deflate the pilot balloon to allow the patient to breath around the ETT, minimising the risk of negative-pressure pulmonary oedema.\nExtubate laterally\nLeft lateral with the head below the level of the heart if high aspiration risk. Especially useful in children as this helps to maintain airway without requiring jaw thrust.\n\n\n\nHigh-Risk Considerations\n\nPlace an airway exchange catheter or exchange wire\nIndicated when reintubation may be potentially anatomically difficult.\n\nCatheter is placed through ETT and left in place after extubation, and can be used as a stylet to guide reintubation\nAirway exchange wires are generally better tolerated, and can be left up to 72 hours\nWires require an exchange catheter to be railroaded prior to an ETT.\n\n\n\n\nAttenuating Physiological Response\nIf it is important to minimise coughing or maintain tight haemodynamics peri-extubation, then consider:\n\nDeep extubation\nExtubation after recovery of spontaneous ventilation but prior to recovery of laryngeal reflexes. Haemodynamically stable but risks both aspiration and airway obstruction; so is contraindicated in patients who are at risk of aspiration, difficult mask ventilation, or difficult reintubation.

Native CO varies on ECMO support but will contribute variably to the total CO:\n\nIdeally, the aortic valve will open each beat to promote some native forward flow\nAbsence leads to LV stasis and significantly ↑ thromboembolic risk.\nNative CO should be periodically assessed at the bedside\n\nPulsatile arterial trace\nEnd-tidal CO2\nEchocardiographcally\n\nInotropic supports should be weaned to the minimum required for AV opening to minimise myocardial work and promote myocardial recovery\n:::column-margin Note that thermodilution is inaccurate on VA ECMO support due to loss of indicator into the ECMO circuit. :::\n\n\n\nAfterload Dependence\nThe pressure gradient across the circuit is significantly greater in VA ECMO compared with VV ECMO, due to the downstream systemic arterial pressure. Consequently:\n\nRPM settings are higher for any given flow, as compared to VV ECMO\nECMO flow is affected by systemic pressure\n↓ Flow with an ↑ in afterload.\n\n\n\nDifferential Hypoxia\n\nDifferential hypoxia is also known as Harlequin syndrome.\n\nDifferential hypoxia occurs when hypoxaemic blood is ejected from the LV whilst oxygenated blood enters the circulation via the ECMO circuit. Differential hypoxia:\n\n\nGas tensions in blood from the ECMO circuit will reflect the function of the oxygenator, and therefore usually be supranormal.\n\nGas tensions in blood from the native CO reflect the function of the respiratory system.\n\nImplies hypoxaemia of blood (predominantly) in the arch vessels\n\nKey tissue beds affected are the heart (via the coronaries), the brain, and the right arm\nLeft SCA and ICA are relatively less affected\n\nOccurs when the:\n\nFunction of the native respiratory system is poor\nSuch that hypoxic blood is return to the LA.\nNative cardiac function is recovering\nSuch that it makes up a reasonable proportion of total cardiac output.\n\nIs affected by the position of the return cannula\nSignificantly ↓ with a central aortic return, as blood should be mixed. Highest risk with a femoral return, as circuit flow favours the caudal regions.\nManagement involves:\n\n↓ native CO\nWean excessive inotropes.\nCorrecting intrapulmonary shunt\n\nPEEP and recruitment\nBronchoscopy\niNO\n\n↑ ECMO flows\nChanging circuit configuration May be indicated if SpO2 &lt;85% despite above therapy.\n\nVV ECMO if cardiac recovery has occurred\nVAV if some ongoing cardiac support required\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection of differential hypoxia is why SpO2 of VA ECMO patients should always be measured on the right arm or ear.\n\n\nWeaning\nWeaning of VA ECMO is more complex than VV ECMO. The process involves:\n\nUnderlying cardiac recovery\nIndicated by ↑ pulsatility with low or no inotropic support.\nConduct of a weaning study:\n\nMonitoring of haemodynamics whilst progressively ↓ circuit flows to 0.5-1L/min\nIncludes echocardiographic assessment\nRequires adequate anticoagulation to prevent sudden oxygenator or pump thrombus due to ↑ stasis\nWeaning studies are limited by the fact that ECMO support is:\n\nNot stopped\nThe last 0.5-1L/min of flow often provides disproportionately high support.\nWeaned only briefly\nUnlike VV ECMO where ECMO support is ceased for hours, ECMO support during a VA wean is reduced only for a short time.\n\n\nSurgical decannulation\nFollowing a successful weaning study, full ECMO flows are restored. Decannulation and actual cessation of support occurs in the OR, as the arterial cannulation sites require formal surgical repair."

The MIC is:\n\nReported as μg/mL\nA lower MIC indicates ↑ efficacy.\nEasily performed\nUsually automated, and therefore reproducible\nAffected significantly by:\n\nIncubation time\n↑ MIC with ↑ time.\nConcentration of bacteria in sample\n↓ MIC with ↓ concentration.\n\nNot a perfect surrogate for in vivo efficacy\n\nOther factors besides MIC determine antibiotic effect\nAntibiotic tissue concentration (at site of disease) may be higher or lower than sampled serum concentration\n\n\n\n\nKill Characteristics\nAntibiotics can effect bacterial genocide in three broad ways:\n\nTime-dependent killing\nEfficacy dependent on the time that antibiotic concentration exceeds MIC, but not by how much.\n\nOccurs when the drug only works at a particular point in the bacterial life cycle\ne.g. Preparation for cell division.\nThreshold effect\n\n\nMaximal effect reached at some proportion (usually 40-70%) of the dosing interval\nDrug concentrations do not have to be continuously over MIC.\nAffected by tissue penetration\nTime over MIC is important only in the tissue where the infection is, which may not be in blood (where we measure concentrations).\n\nLend themselves to dosing by infusion\n\nBenefits (at steady-state) include:\n\n↑ Time above MIC, which should ↑ efficacy and ↓\n↓ Peak concentration, which generally ↓ toxicity\n↓ Nursing workload\n\nDisadvantages include:\n\n↓ Concentration gradient driving diffusion into tissues\nMost drugs are not pure time-dependent killers, and ↑ concentration still results in some ↑ efficacy\nMIC is not known in early stages of treatment\nConsumes a lumen continuously\n\nMay ↓ ventilator days without clear evidence of mortality benefit, with greatest effect seen in the critically ill\n\nExamples include:\n\nβ-lactam\nCarbapenems\nLinezolid\n\n\nConcentration-dependent killing\nEfficacy dependent on how much antibiotic concentration exceeds MIC, but not by how long for.\n\nOccurs when drug affects some critical component of bacterial infrastructure\n\nGreater effect with greater dose\nExamples include:\n\nAminoglycosides\nMetronidazole\nFluoroquinolones\n\n\nTime and concentration-dependent killing\nEfficacy dependent on both time over MIC and concentration above MIC.\n\nOccurs for drugs which prevent synthesis of components for cell division\n\n↑ Concentration results in ↑ inhibition of relevant components\n↑ Time results in affecting a greater number of bacteria\nAs they won’t all divide at the same time.\n\nExamples include:\n\nFluoroquinolones\nAzithromycin\nGlycopeptides\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Antibiotic Effect\nThe post-antibiotic effect describes bacterial killing that persists after the concentration falls below MIC. Post-antibiotic effects:\n\nAre an idiosyncratic feature of some agents\nUsually where the drug binds strongly to some part of the bacteria.\nAre strongest generally for drugs with concentration-dependent killing\n\n\n\nTreatment Failure\nAntibiotic treatment failure may occur due to:\n\nWrong bug\n\nNot susceptible\n\nViral\nFungal\nParasitic\n\nNot infection\n\nWrong drug\n\nResistant organism\nPoor penetration to infected tissue\nBacteriostatic antagonism\nAdministration of a bacteriostatic antibiotic may ↓ efficacy of a bacteriocidal antibiotic, as cell division cannot be interrupted if it does not occur.\n\nWrong dose\n\nToo small\nToo infrequent\nToo short\n\nWrong route\n\nInadequate oral absorption\n\nSource control\n\nIncomplete surgical resection\nInadequate sputum clearance"

Drugs may require:\n\n\nIn general:\n\nInterval-adjustment:\n\nAminoglycosides\nFluoroquinolones\nGlycopeptides\n\nDose or Interval adjustment:\nFor drugs not particularly toxic in overdose either can be chosen, although interval adjustment is cheaper.\n\nBeta-lactams\nCarbapenems\n\n\n\nDose adjusted\n\nBest for both:\n\nTime-dependent killing\nTime above MIC determines efficacy, but amount above MIC doesn’t.\nConcentration-dependent toxicity\n\n\nMaintains time above MIC, with ↓ dosing to avoid progressively ↑ drug levels when amount given exceeds amount cleared\n\nInterval adjusted\n\nBest for both:\n\nConcentration-dependent killing\nPeak concentration should be 8-10 times MIC, but the time above MIC doesn’t effect efficacy.\nConcentration-dependent toxicity\n\nMaintains the high peak concentration required for killing, but minimises concentration at other times\n\n\n\n\nRenal Replacement Therapy\nDose adjustment on RRT is similar to renal failure. In general, drugs can require:\n\nNo adjustment\nAdministration is unchanged due to:\n\nSmall free drug fraction\n\nHigh VD\nHighly protein bound\n\nHepatically cleared\nCleared by filtration\nCRRT replicates glomerular filtration reasonably well, but not other forms of renal clearance.\n\nInterval adjustment\n\n\nActively transported drugs\nRenal clearance by tubular secretion is not replicated by CRRT, and so interval adjustment needed to ↓ toxicity.\n\nDose adjustment\n\n\nRenally reabsorbed drugs\nDrugs that are usually reabsorbed by the tubule undergo increased clearance in the kidney, and therefore require ↑ dose on RRT."

This requires:\n\nRequires a greater-effect site concentration when used alone Typically an effect-site concentration of 7μg/ml is a reasonable starting point in most well adult patients.\n\nCheck to see if the bolus/loading dose given appears reasonable\nReduction can be achieved with another analgesic, consider:\n\nRemifentanil\nNitrous oxide\n\n\nTitration to effect\n\nDepth of anaesthesia monitoring\nLoss of haemodynamic response or limb movement to vigorous jaw thrust\nLoss of haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy\n\nCease infusion once final sutures are applied, before application of dressings\nThe decrement time is useful for timing emergence:\n\nDecrement time set to a Ce at 1.8 appears to be a reliable marker for extubation in children\n\n\nSuggested Cp for propofol TIVA:\n\n\n\nSole Agent\nAdjuncts\n\n\n\n\n4-6μg/ml\n3-4μg/ml\n\n\n\n\n\nPropofol/Remifentanil TIVA for GA\nThis combination:\n\nAllows provision of strong intraoperative analgesia and anaesthesia with a rapid-wake up\nCan be initiated in three ways:\n\nBoth agents with effect-site targeting\nAgents should be started simultaneously.\nEffect-site propofol target with plasma-site remifentanil target\nPropofol will equilibrate with the effect site much more rapidly than remifentanil. Therefore:\n\nA greater dose of propofol will be required, reducing the efficacy of the synergy of these drugs\nStarting the propofol after the remifentanil has equilibrated will achieve a much more rapid induction\n\nPlasma-site propofol target with plasma-site remifentanil target\nIn this instance, remifentanil will equilibrate with the effect site more rapidly. This leads to:\n\nA period of awareness with apnoea\nThis can be overcome with over-pressuring the propofol, but this may lead to adverse CVS effects.\n\n\nCease propofol infusion once final sutures applied\nRemifentanil infusion can be:\n\nCeased with the propofol infusion\nCeased (e.g. 30 minutes) prior to the end of the case\nWith administration of a long-acting opioid to provide post-operative analgesia.\n\n\nLong-acting may also be given throughout the case to reduce remifentanil requirements and (theoretically) opioid hyperalgesia\nLong-acting should be given ~30-40 minutes prior to ceasing a remifentanil infusion\nA dose of 0.1-0.3mg/kg of morphine can be used.\n\nContinued at a target of 1-2μg/ml for a smooth, cough-free extubation\n\n\nSuggested minimum effect-site concentrations for propofol/remifentanil TIVA in adults:\n\n\n\nAge\nSpontaneously Ventilating\n\n\n\n\n⩽50\nPPF: 4-6μg/ml  Remi: 1-3ng/ml\n\n\n⩾50\nPPF: 2-4ug/ml  Remi: 1-2ng/ml"

Characterised by an inability to consistently abstain, impaired behavioural control, craving, and impaired recognition of problems with behaviours and interpersonal relationships.\n\n\nRisk Factors\nGeneral:\n\nFamily history of drug abuse\nChildhood abuse\nFamily dysfunction\nMental health disorder\nMale\nExperimenting with drugs/alcohol\nPeers who use drugs\nSense of professional immunity from addiction\n\nSpecific:\n\nDirect contact with drugs\nImmediate availability\nEasy to divert\n\n\n\nClinical Manifestations\n\nDisease process usually well-advanced by the time physical and behavioural changes become noticeable\n\nInside the hospital:\n\nBehavioural\n\nDeteriorating relationships\nMood swings\nPoor reliability\nFrequent change of jobs\n\nClinical\n\nPoor administration and record keeping\n\nUnaccounted for drugs\n\nDisproportionate post-operative pain compared with anaesthetic record\nHigh doses of narcotic used in anaesthesia\nPreference for working alone\nDifficult to find between cases or when on call\nAt hospital when not on call\nRequesting extra shifts\nUnusually willing to take on additional work commitments\nCarrying syringes and ampoules in clothing\nIV equipment in non-clinical places\nWearing of long-sleeved gowns\n\n\nOutside of hospital:\n\nWithdrawal from family, friends, and hobbies\nNeglect and deterioration in appearance\nMood swings\nFatigue, lethargy\nPoor concentration, memory\nFrequent unexplained illnesses\nLegal problems\nFinancial problems\n\n\n\nMandatory Notification\nLaw mandates reporting:\n\nPracticing whilst intoxicated\nSexual misconduct\nPlacing patient at risk through impairment\nPatient at risk through practice which constitutes a significant departure from accepted professional standard\n\n\n\nInvestigation\nProcess will vary:\n\nSufficient evidence will usually mandate immediate investigation\nLack of evidence may need a period of monitoring\nInterviews with senior staff (e.g. nurses)\nPolice involvement if criminal activity\n\nMeeting with the person:\n\nNeeds to be planned in advance\nHave suitable contacts available:\n\nOccupational medicine\nPsychiatry\nANZCA

alternative staff\n\nColleague health\n\nPrivate and confidential\nSignificant reputation and career risk with allegation\n\nStatutory reporting obligations\n\n\n\nRecovery\nIn general:\n\nSustained abstinence occurs in 74-90%\nAnaesthetists similar to general doctors.\nMedian time time to relapse is 2.6 years.\n\nMortality of 13%\n\n\nRe-entry:\n\nAssessment by medical board\nRequires supervision\nLimitation of practice\nRestricted access to drugs\nDrug testing\n\nBlood\nUrine\n\nHair\nHair testing is preferable to verify abstinence due to longer lead time.\n\n\n\n\nAngres Criteria\n\nUsed to stratify likelihood of returning to anaesthesia:\n\nCategory I\nReturn immediately after treatment.\n\nTremendous love for/commitment to anaesthesia\nAccepts and understands the disease\nBonding with AA (or narcotics anonymous) and has a sponsor\nStrong family support\nCommitted to recovery\nBalanced lifestyle\nNo evidence of dual diagnosis, for example, bipolar disorder\nTreatment team, anaesthetic department, and employer support return\n\nCategory II\nPossibility of return.\n\nRelapsed with recovery underway\nDysfunctional but improving family situation\nInvolved, but not bonded with AA/NA\nImproving recovery skills\nSome denial remains\nMood swings without other psychiatric diagnosis\n\nCategory III\nRedirection to another specialty.\n\nProlonged i.v. use\nPrior treatment failure and relapses\nDisease clearly remains active\nWent into anaesthesia for drug access\nDysfunctional family\nNon-compliant with regulatory bodies\nPoor recovery skills and no bonding with AA/NA, no sponsor\nSevere co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis\n\n\n\n\nResources\nIn Australia, resources include:\n\nWelfare of Anaesthetists Special

Management of issues of insertion and troubleshooting an inadequate or failing epidural are covered elsewhere.\n\nFoetal Distress\nFoetal distress after an epidural is common, and may be:\n\nDirect\nRelated to effects of epidural drugs on the foetus, as some will be absorbed by the mother and transferred to the foetus. Effects seen depend on the type of drug, but are not clinically significant:\n\nOpioid\nRespiratory depression.\nLA\n\n\nTransient reduced variability\n\n\nIndirect\nRelated to effects on the mother by epidural. Include:\n\nMaternal ↓ BP\nMaternal symptholysis results in reduced uteroplacental perfusion, and foetal ischaemia. Requires correction of BP and intrauterine resuscitation.\nOxytocin/Adrenaline Imbalance\nTheory based on the fact that rapid onset of analgesia results in a rapid fall in the circulating (tocolytic) adrenaline, resulting in unopposed oxytocin stimulation and a subsequent fall in uteroplacental perfusion due to the high intrauterine pressure. Notably, foetal distress does not appear to be ↑ with a CSE, despite the more rapid onset of analgesia with this technique.\nMaternal Positioning\nPosition for epidural may result in foetus compressing cord and reducing perfusion."

Pip will be ↑ but alveolar pressures will be significantly ↓ due to the airway obstruction. Once ventilation is established, Pplat should be assessed with an inspiratory hold and should be maintained at &lt;25cmH2O.\n\nHaemodynamic deterioration following intubation is often due to dynamic hyperinflation\nThe ventilator should be disconnected and prolonged (60s) expiration allowed to occur to reduce cardiac compression, before continuing ventilation at a lower rate.\n\n\nB\n\nOxygen\nTarget SpO2 94-98%.

Useful as an induction agent for endotracheal intubation or as a component of post-intubation sedation, but not independently of this.\nVolatile\nMany inhaled anaesthetic agents (sevoflurane, isoflurane, enflurane, halothane) are effective direct bronchodilators, with use limited by requiring an intubated patient and a ventilator capable of administering them.\n\n\nNon-Invasive Ventilation\nPEEP ↓ inspiratory threshold work and may split open small airways, whilst Psup ↓ inspiratory work and ↑ Vt and MV.\n\nIndicated for:\n\nModerate-severe dyspnoea or ↑ work of breathing\nRespiratory acidosis\n\nCommence with:\n\nCPAP 5cmH2O\n↑ If difficulty initiating inspiration.\nPsup 8-10cmH2O\n↑ If low Vt/ RR.\n\nTarget Vt ~7mL/kg, RR ~25\n\nVV ECMO\nMay be required if oxygenation is unable to be managed effectively following intubation.\n\n\n\n\nTo initiate gas flow into the lungs, the patient must generate enough inspiratory force such that Palv &lt; Patm.\n\nIf iPEEP is high, then a very negative intrapleural pressure must be generated before Palv is less than Patm and inspiration commences. Application of external PEEP reduces this gradient, and therefore reduces the amount of work performed before inspiration commences (inspiratory threshold work).\n\nNote that this differs from the controlled ventilation settings, because NIV assumes spontaneous breathing. Inspiratory threshold work is irrelevant in fully controlled ventilation.\nSpecific therapy:\n\nPharmacological\nCommunity management of asthma is a cornerstone of preventing severe exacerbations. Agents used include:\n\nInhaled “preventers”\nUsually one (or combination therapy) of:\n\nLong-acting beta-agonists\ne.g. Salmeterol.\nInhaled corticosteroids\ne.g. Fluticasone.\n\nLeukotriene antagonists\n\nPhysical\n\nAsthma management plan\n\n\nDisposition:\n\nIntensive care admission is recommended for:\n\nSevere asthma\nRespiratory arrest\nAltered mental state\nDysrhythmias\nMyocardial ischaemia\n\n\n\nMarginal and Ineffective Therapies\n\nAminophylline\nInferior bronchodilator relative to others available, with a narrow therapeutic range and poor side effect profile.\nHeliox\n70% helium/30% oxygen mixture improves work of breathing and effect of inhaled bronchodilators.

Considerations:\n\nThe disease and degree of recruitable lung is highly heterogenous and often over-distension and under-recruitment will occur together\nHigher PEEP is associated with better outcomes in more severe disease, and worse outcomes in milder disease\nInadequate PEEP tends to cause under-recruitment and hypoxia\nExcessive PEEP tends to cause over-distension, ↑ lung stress, and reduced cardiac output\nIdeal PEEP is described by the Open Lung Approach\nPEEP at which the lung volume is maintained at FRC, thereby:\n\nMaximally recruiting available alveoli\nSpreading Vt over a greater number of alveoli\nReducing Pip\nDeceasing Barotrauma and volutrauma\n\n\nAppropriate FiO2\nHigh FiO2 is associated with diffuse alveolar damage.

Harm from dysoxia is a function of:\n\nDuration\nLimited with rapid correction.\nTissue type\nHigh oxygen demand and extraction organs have poor tolerance to tissue hypoxia.\n\nHypoxia sensitive:\n\nHeart\nBrain\n\nHypoxia less-sensitive:\n\nKidney\nSkin\n\n\n\nDysoxia can occur when DO2 is apparently adequate, and results from either:\n\nFailure of cells to utilise available oxygen\nSometimes referenced as histotoxic shock or cytopathic hypoxia.\nIntra-organ arteriolar shunting preventing oxygen delivery to the cell, despite adequate organ oxygen delivery\n\n\n\n\nAetiology\nCauses by mechanism include:\n\nHypovolaemic\n\nBlood loss\n\nTrauma\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nGIT\nObstetric\nRetroperitoneal\nIntra-abdominal\n\nFluid loss\n\nGIT losses\nSweating\nPolyuria\nPancreatitis\nBurns\n\n\nObstructive\n\nTamponade\nTension pneumothorax\nPE\nDynamic obstruction\n\nCardiogenic\n\nMyocardium\n\nIschaemia\n\nRupture\n\nMyocarditis\nContusion\nMyopathy\n\nSeptic\nDrug toxicity\n\n\nValvular\n\nThrombus\nChordae rupture\n\nArrhythmia\n\nBradyarrhythmia\nTachyarrhythmia\n\n\nDistributive\n\nSepsis\nSIRS/MODS\nAnaphylaxis\nNeurogenic\nAdrenal\nThyroid\nDrug toxicity"

    "text": "Management\n\nManagement of AF has traditionally been divided into two competing strategies:\n\nRate control\nRemain in AF, with controlled ventricular rate. Requires anticoagulation.\nRhythm control\nConversion to sinus rhythm. May be superior to rate control, if it can be achieved, and is desirable in patients:\n\n&lt;60\nStructurally normal hearts\nReversible precipitant of AF\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate/rhythm control debate is made more complex by the fact that rate control strategies result in SR in ~35% of patients, and rhythm control fails in 40-60% of patients. Rhythm control agents (amiodarone, flecainide) also have poorer side effect profiles than rate control agents.\n\nOverall, rhythm control is probably superior if it can be consistently achieved without requirement for heavy-duty antiarrhythmics; and so is most ideal in a young patient, without structural heart disease, and good cardiac reserve.\nResuscitation:\n\nRhythm control\n\nSpecific Therapy:\n\nPharmacological\n\nHaemodynamic control\nOne of:\n\nRhythm control\nRate control\n\nAnticoagulation\n\nProcedural\n\nAblation\nAchieves drug-free rhythm control in &gt;80% after one attempt, and &gt;90% after two attempts.\nLAA occlusion\nLAA ligation\nLeft pericardiotomy\nMAZE\n\n\n\n\nLAA ligation, left pericardiotomy, and MAZE all are performed as an addition to another cardiac surgery to prevent post-operative AF, and are not performed as singular procedures.\nSupportive Care:\n\nTreat precipitant\n\n\nRhythm Control\n\nUrgent electrical cardioversion is recommended for haemodynamically unstable AF with RVR - just as with other unstable tachyarrhythmias.\n\nCardioversion describes restoration of normal sinus rhythm, and is associated with a temporary ↑ stroke risk, as any clot formed in the static atria may embolise when atrial contraction resumes.

Ensure this has dried completely before proceeding.\nSterile scrub, gown, and glove\nDraw up drugs\n\nSkin LA\nLA +/- opioid for spinal injection\n\nPlace sterile drape\nLocate a suitable interspinous space\n\nFeel for the protrusions of a spinous process\nDeep palpation may be required.\nRunning the thumb down the back can help identify where the optimal space is\n\nRaise a skin weal of LA\nTypically the best insertion site is lower in the space.\nFurther injections of LA into ligament\nUse this opportunity to map the bony anatomy.\nPlace introducer into interspinous ligament\nEnsure that a dural puncture is not achieved in thin patients.\n\nPerpendicular to skin is the ideal starting direction\n\nInsert spinal needle through introducer\nIf bone is reached, with draw the spinal needle into the introducer and redirect the introducer\nWhen a loss of resistance is felt, withdraw the introducer\n\nLook for clear CSF flow\nThis may take 20-30s in a small-gauge needle, especially if the patient is lateral. Replace the stylet and advance the needle further.\n\nOnce free-flow of CSF is obtained:\n\nFor diagnostic LP:\n\nAttach manometer and measure fluid pressure\nThen fill CSF tubes in series\nTypically 10 drops in each.\n\nFor spinal anaesthesia:\n\nAttach syringe to spinal needle\nAspirate CSF\nSwirling of CSF within syringe should be seen.\nSlowly inject local anaesthetic\n\nRepeat aspiration during and at the end of injection\n\nEnsures needle remained within CSF throughout and inadvertent epidural injection did not occur\nProvides barbotage\nMay achieve a more rapid onset and extent of block.\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting Insertion\n\nUnable to locate subarachnoid space\n\nEnsure the patient is positioned correctly\n\nNo shoulder rotation\nSagittal planes are aligned\n\nAdjusting needle direction\n\nRedirect cranially\nIf still hitting bone, redirect cranially again\nEntering in the bottom of a space assists this approach, as the needle can be ‘walked-off’ the lower spinous process\nRedirect caudally\n\nChanging introducer position\n\nMove the introducer ~0.5-1cm lower in the space\nPlace the introducer in a different space\n\nUse a bigger spinal needle\n\n\nThinner needles are more flexible, and may divert their path away from calcified or hard parts of the ligament\n\nConsider a lateral approach\n\nElectrical or stabbing pain\nNeedle has likely struck a spinal nerve root within the CSF.\n\nWithdraw the stylet and monitor for CSF flow\nIf no flow, withdraw and readjust angle away from side of pain\n\nContinuous flow of blood\nNeedle is likely within an epidural vein.\n\nReplace stylet and continue to advance"
