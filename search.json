Some other jurisdictions accept brain-stem death as sufficient, and vary as to the procedural requirements to determine brain death.\n\nDetermination of brain death requires:\n\nMeeting preconditions\n\nConsistent lesion\nNo reversible cause\nPossible to diagnose\n\nClinical assessment\nConsisting of both:\n\nObservation period\nSustained period with absence of neurological activity.\nClinical testing\nFormal testing by two clinicians.\n\n\n\n\nTime of death is the completion of examination by the second doctor.\n\nPreconditions\nFor brain stem testing to be appropriate, the following preconditions must be met:\n\n\nDue to the immaturity of brain-stem reflexes, brain death cannot be determined in preterm neonates, and ↑ caution should be used in neonates and infants.\n\nA brain lesion consistent with a diagnosis of brain death\nNeuroimaging consistent with acute brain pathology that could cause brain death. Only in the case of HIE is imaging not required, and the diagnosis may be made on history alone.\nAbsence of physiological and anatomical confounders of assessment:\n\nNo high cervical spine injury\nMust be able to assess:\n\nUpper limb motor response to central stimulus\nCentral response (grimace) to upper limb stimulus\nCough reflex\n\nNormotensive\nSBP ≥90mmHg or MAP &gt;60mmHg in adults, or age-appropriate perfusion pressure in children.\nNo effect of sedation or analgesia\nThe amount of elapsed time required since the last administration varies on the drug, dose, and degree of any renal or hepatic dysfunction.\n\nThis is fundamentally a question of clinical judgment\nThiopentone plasma levels should be &lt;10mg/L\nDrug antagonists can be used if there is any doubt about persisting drug effect\n\nNo muscle relaxation\nConfirm with train-of-four.\nNormothermia\n≥ 36.5°C. Hypothermia depresses consciousness, and brainstem reflexes may be absent &lt;28°C.\nAbsence of severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte derangements\n\nGlucose: &lt;3 or &gt;25mmol/L\nSodium: &lt;125 or &gt;160mmol/L\nPhosphate: &lt;0.5mmol/L\nMagnesium: &lt;0.5mmol/L\nUrea: &gt;40mmol/L\nSevere hypothyroidism\nSevere hypoadrenalism\n\nNo acute liver failure or decompensated chronic liver disease\n\nAbility to perform clinical testing\n\n\nAbility to assess brain stem reflexes\nAt least one functioning eye and ear.\nAbility to perform apnoea test\nNeuromuscular system capable of independent respiration (e.g. no high cervical spine injury), saturations able to be maintained with supplemental oxygen.\n\n\n\n\nConditions which may mimic brain death include:\n\nNeurological\n\nGBS\n\nMiller-Fisher\n\n\nDrug and Toxin\n\nBaclofen\nValproic acid\nOrganophosphate intoxication\n\n\n\n\nObservation Period\nPrior to performing clinical testing, a minimum of 4 hours of observation should be performed during which the:\n\n\nThe observation period should be extended to 24 hours in the case of HIE or hypothermia &gt;6 hours.\n\nPreconditions are met\nGCS is 3\nNon-reactive pupils\nMay be mid-sized or dilated.\nNo spontaneous respiratory effort\nAbsent cough reflex\n\n\n\nSince all patients undergoing brain death testing will be intubated, GCS 3 is GCS 2T.\n\n\nClinical Testing\n\nEach Australian state has slightly different requirements around the qualifications, experience, and relationship to the patient of the clinicians determining brain death.\n\nEquipment required for testing:\n\nPen torch\nGauze or cotton wool\nOtoscope\n50mL syringe\nAnd a cannula, or use a Toomey syringe.\nLaryngoscope\nTongue depressor\nCold ice water\nKidney dish\nTo collect cold ice water.\n\n\n\nIn order to help the testing process flow smoothly, ↓ the minute ventilation so that the PaCO2 is close to the upper limit of normal and place the patient on 100% oxygen at the start of testing. If the minute ventilation and PaCO2 are stable, the pre-apnoea ABG can also be taken prior to commencing testing.\nClinical testing is performed separately by two suitably trained and experienced clinicians (at least one a specialist), and requires:\n\nComa\nGCS 3, confirmed by absence of motor response following painful stimulus applied centrally (bilaterally) and to all four limbs.\n\n\n\nFamily should be offered the opportunity to observe clinical testing, after appropriate explanation (particularly about spinal reflexes) and support.

Apnoea testing assesses ventilatory drive, and is performed by:\n\nPreoxygenation with 100% O2\nExpose the chest to evaluate for respiratory effort\nVentilator disconnection\nHypoxia (SpO2 &lt;88%) should be avoided; attach a self-inflating bag with a PEEP valve to prevent atelectasis and provide some passive entrainment.\nNo respiratory effort when:\n\nPaCO2 is ≥60mmHg, OR\nExpect PaCO2 to ↑ by ~3mmHg/min as a guide for when to perform the ABG.\nPaCO2 has risen 20mmHg above baseline\nExpect ~3mmHg of rise per minute, so leave 7-10 minutes until testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of suction catheter or t-piece to provide passive oxygenation during apnoea testing is not recommended.\n\nFor patients on ECMO during apnoea testing:\n\nPreoxygenate via the lung and circuit\n↑ PaCO2 to &gt;45mmHg on the circuit\nAttach a CPAP circuit as describe above\n↓ Sweep to 0.5-1L/min\n\nThe time of death is the time of the second set of testing. This should be discussed with family in advance as:\n\nCertain times may be important for the family\nThe patient will look the same after they have died as they did before\nStill warm, “breathing” on the ventilator.\n\n\n\nSpinal Reflexes\nSpinal reflexes are movements due to loss of higher centre inhibition of a reflex arc, are compatible with brain death and:\n\nOccur:\n\nIn up to 50% of patients\nUsually within 24 hours of death, though can stretch to days\nConsistently\nMay be highly variable between patients, but usually repeatable within a given patient.\n\nInclude:\n\nUpper limb extension-pronation\nLower limb flexion\nDeep tendon reflexes\nLazarus sign\nBilateral arm flexion, shoulder adduction, hand raising above chest.\nPlantar response",

Some institutions may routinely perform radiological investigations in addition to clinical assessment, but this is not required to establish a diagnosis of brain death.\nKey investigations:\n\n4-vessel angiogram\nDemonstrating absence of flow above the carotid siphon in the anterior circulation and foramen magnum in the posterior circulation.

    "section": "Discussing Concepts",
    "text": "Discussing Concepts\n\nThis is a phrase library of concepts around transplant, organ donation, and the donation process.\n\n\nDonation\nOrgan Donation:\n\nPeople can donate organs if they pass away in very specific circumstances\nSometimes people register to do this while they are still alive, so that there is a record of it when they have passed\nOther times doctors will ask the family if they wish to donate\nIt is always a very hard time to think about such a serious thing, but this is the only time it can happen\nFamily don’t have to decide immediately and have some time to talk and think about it, but the decision does have to be made within a couple of days\nOrgans that can be donated include heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and pancreas\n\nTissue Donation:\n\nTissue donation is different to organ donation because almost anyone can become a tissue donor, irrespective of how they died\nTissues donation can occur some time after death and so is not as urgent\nTissues that can be donated include:\n\nCornea\nOuter layer of the eye used for those blinded from disease of their own cornea.\nHeart valves\nTo replace damaged heart valves.\nSkin\nUsed to replace skin in those with serious burns.\nBone\nTendons\nTo help repair damaged joints.\n\n\nOrgan Donation Process:\n\nBlood tests and sometimes x-rays or ultrasound is done to make sure the organs are healthy enough for transplant\nSometimes, the person will receive medicine to make sure the organs stay healthy enough to transplant\nThe organ will go to the next person on the waiting list who is a good fit\n\nYou can’t choose who the organs will go to\n\nThere’s a lot of organisation that has to happen before the organ donation goes ahead so it can take some time\nNeed to arrange:\n\nThe team who removes the organs\nThe patients who need the organs have to come into hospital\nThe teams who put in the organs into each patient\nThe transport for all of these\n\nThe donation operation:\n\nMay take up to 6 hours, depending on how many organs are being donated\nThe cut is closed up afterwards and covered with a special dressing\nThe body is then taken to the hospital mortuary\nThey will look different afterwards as their heart will have stopped beating\nThe family can see the body afterwards if they want to\nThere are no problems having an open-casket funeral after this operation\n\n\nAfter Organ Donation:\n\nThe family will get a call letting them know what was transplanted and how the recipients are doing\nThe family can’t contact the recipients directly, but can write to them through DonateLife\nThe recipients can also write to the family through DonateLife in the same way\n\n\n\nBrain Death\nOverview:\n\nThe brain is a soft and fragile organ that is protected in the skull\nThe brain keeps us alive by sending messages to all the other parts of the body to control them, and also lets us see, smell, hear, and think\nIf our brain very badly damaged then it can swell so much that blood can’t get to it\nThis can lead to death of the brain, even though the other parts of the body may not be as badly damaged\n\nBrain Death Testing:\n\nWe test for brain death through a formal process that tests the vital functions of the brain, such as coughing and breathing\nIf these tests confirm what we think is going on, then it means that the brain has died, and that means that they have died\n\nThey have died even though their heart continues to beat and the breathing machine keeps giving air\n\nYou are welcome to watch these tests\n\nSome people find it helpful to watch the testing\nOther people find it distressing\nIf you want to watch, someone will be with you to support you and tell you what is going on\n\nThe time of death is the the time that the second set of tests are done\nThey will look the same after this set of testing as they are still on the breathing machine\n\nDonation after brain death:\n\nIf they become an organ donor, they will look like this when they go to the operating room for the donation procedure\n\n\n\nCirculatory Death\nOverview:\n\nSometimes:\n\nThe brain is damaged very badly but some parts of the brain still work a little\nThis does not meet the criteria for brain death, but is still not a recoverable injury.\nThe person may be very sick and cannot survive without the breathing machine\n\nAt this point, we no longer think the breathing tube is helping them\nWe are not sure how long they will survive without the breathing tube, but we will focus on their comfort during this time\nThis usually happens within 10-20 minutes, but sometimes takes hours or days\n\nDonation after circulatory death:\n\nDonation can only happen if death occurs within a specific timeframe\n\nThis is so the possible damage to organs is minimised, which happens when they are without blood flow\n\nMedication will be given to relieve pain or distress\nPredicting time between withdrawal of support to death is hard\n\nOrgan donation may not be possible\nTissue donation may still occur\n\nYou can withdraw consent at any time\n\n\n\nTransplant\n\nWhen someones organs - body parts - are healthy, they can live a normal life\nWhen these organs get sick, then people are often very sick and it changes what they can do\nFor example:\n\nSomeone with sick kidneys may need to go on a machine called dialysis\nThis means they have to spend several hours at hospital 3 days a week\nThey are often very tired and can’t do much or work much even when they are not at hospital\nIf they get a healthy kidney put in, then they don’t need dialysis anymore and can get back to a more normal life",

    "section": "A Framework for Airway Management",
    "text": "A Framework for Airway Management\n\nThere are many frameworks for airway management. This one aims to:\n\nFocus on a general plan but not on any specific technique\nProvide an approach that is appropriate for elective anaesthesia as well as emergency airway management\nPlan for and avoid the difficult airway\nIn the patient who does not require immediate intubation\n\n\n\nPlan\n\nEvaluate what techniques are available\nBased on the equipment, the patient, and technical skills. Think ACORNS:\n\nAwake\n\nWaking the patient\nAwake laryngoscopy\nAwake FOI\nIs there laryngeal or tracheal pathology?\n\nCricoid/FONA\n\nScalpel cricothyrotomy\nNeedle cricothyrotomy\n\nOral\n\nMask ventilation\nIntubation\nWith and without VL.\n\nNasal\nIs the oral route impossible?\n\nIntubation\nIncluding blind.\n\nSupraglotic\n\nUse of LMA\nUse of iLMA\n\n\nFor this patient, consider which techniques are:\n\nPreferred\nDepending on the indication for airway management. In most critical care situations (compared to elective anaesthesia), this will be a definitive oral airway.\nFeasible\nCould be used to maintain oxygenation +/- ventilation, but may not necessarily be definitive.\nUnfeasible\nCertain techniques may not be appropriate in certain patients.\n\nOf this short-list of options, decide on a hierarchy of techniques\nPlan for failure and have a series of identified rescue techniques, including a plan for:\n\nRescue ventilation\nAlternate device, e.g. LMA, iLMA.\nRescue intubation\nAlternate device.\n\nConsider which drugs will be required for these techniques\n\nPatient\nAdequate patient preparation prior to induction reduces incidence of difficult tracheal intubation. Think PROC:\n\n\nPositioning\n\n\nEnsure EAM is level with sternal notch to maximise ease of intubation\nRamping ↑ FRC in the obese patient\n\nRecruitment\nUse of CPAP during preoxygenation prolongs safe apnoea time in obese patients.\nOxygenate\nInvolves adequate denitrogenation, and consideration of apnoeic oxygenation.\n\nPreoxygenation/denitrogenation\nEtO2 &gt; 80% indicates a good proportion of FRC is oxygen, significantly prolonging safe apnoea times from 1-2 minutes up to 8 minutes.\n\nNote that reduced FRC (e.g. atelectasis) will lead to shunt and rapid drop in SpO2 despite a high ETO2 fraction\nSignificant shunt will result in an SpO2 of &lt; 100% despite adequate ETO2.\nThis can only be achieved when breathing oxygen through a closed-circuit system\n\nApnoeic oxygenation\nDelivery of oxygen via nasal cannula during the apnoeic period. This technique:\n\nRequires a patent airway\nMay not help during the apnoeic period when airway tone is reduced.\nMay be performed with:\n\nStandard nasal cannula from wall oxygen at 15L.min-1\nHumidified\n\nMay be useful when:\n\nFRC/ is compromised\nLaryngoscopy is difficult\n\n\n\n\n\nPerform\n\nComplete pre-airway management checklist\nDuring pre-oxygenation periods.\nBegin!\n\n\n\nAirway Management Mental Checklist\nA good mental checklist should be:\n\nEasy to remember\nAllows it to be used as a ‘challenge-confirm’ checklist - i.e. the steps can be performed by multiple providers simultaneously and then the checklist is used to verify tasks have been completed\nAppropriate to be used by a single provider as a ‘call-do-response’ checklist when working with an unfamiliar team\n\nThe SPEEDBOMB checklist:\n\n\nThere are many different checklists - I like this one. I routinely perform it during the pause that is provided during pre-oxygenation.\n\nSuction\n\nAvailable\nConsider gastric drainage if NGT is in situ\n\nPosition\nIn optimal position for this particular technique.\n\nEar-to-sternal notch\n\nEnd-tidal CO2\nAvailable and working.\nEquipment\nThe kit needed for the chosen techniques.\n\nBVM\nWith mask and PEEP valve.\nAirway adjuncts\nNPA and OPA available.\nLaryngoscope\n\nTwo working laryngoscopes\nLubricated\nCritically ill patients often have high sympathetic tone and a dry oropharynx, making advancement of an unlubricated blade down the tongue difficult.\nAppropriate sized blades\n\nLMA\nLubed and inflated as desired.\nETT\n\n\nOf appropriate size\nLubricated\nAt least two, including a smaller one\nIf concerned about upper airway pathology/burns, have a size 6 available\n\nAdjuncts to ETT\n\nBougie\nMust always be available.\nStylet\nSyringe\nFor cuff inflation.\n\n\nDrugs\nIncluding desired dose.\n\nInduction agents\n\nMuscle relaxant\nIf concerned, always use adequate doses of a rapid-onset NMBD.\nOpioid\nVasopressors\n\nBackup plan\nDouble check the availability of backup equipment, including FONA equipment.\nOxygen\n\nSupply present and connected\nEnsure that the oxygen tubing attached to the flowmeter is also attached to the patient.\nAdequate pre-oxygenation/denitrogenation period\nUse of PEEP for lung recruitment prior to induction\n\nMonitoring\n\nECG\nSpO2\nBP\n\nBriefing\n\nAllocate roles\nDetail airway plan A, B, etc\nDeclare at what points the airway management strategy will change\ne.g. “If the SpO2 falls to less than 93%, I will cease intubation attempts and return to BVM. If unable to mask ventilate, I will place an LMA.”",

Haemodynamically stable but risks both aspiration and airway obstruction; so is contraindicated in patients who are at risk of aspiration, difficult mask ventilation, or difficult reintubation.

    "text": "Concepts\nInclude:\n\nNative cardiac function\nAfterload dependence\nDifferential Hypoxia\nWeaning\n\n\nNative Cardiac Function\nVA ECMO adds a second paralell circuit to the circulation, which bypasses the lungs. Native CO varies on ECMO support but will contribute variably to the total CO:\n\nIdeally, the aortic valve will open each beat to promote some native forward flow\nAbsence leads to LV stasis and significantly ↑ thromboembolic risk.\nNative CO should be periodically assessed at the bedside\n\nPulsatile arterial trace\nEnd-tidal CO2\nEchocardiographcally\n\nInotropic supports should be weaned to the minimum required for AV opening to minimise myocardial work and promote myocardial recovery\n:::column-margin Note that thermodilution is inaccurate on VA ECMO support due to loss of indicator into the ECMO circuit. :::\n\n\n\nAfterload Dependence\nThe pressure gradient across the circuit is significantly greater in VA ECMO compared with VV ECMO, due to the downstream systemic arterial pressure. Consequently:\n\nRPM settings are higher for any given flow, as compared to VV ECMO\nECMO flow is affected by systemic pressure\n↓ Flow with an ↑ in afterload.\n\n\n\nDifferential Hypoxia\n\nDifferential hypoxia is also known as Harlequin syndrome.\n\nDifferential hypoxia occurs when hypoxaemic blood is ejected from the LV whilst oxygenated blood enters the circulation via the ECMO circuit. Differential hypoxia:\n\n\nGas tensions in blood from the ECMO circuit will reflect the function of the oxygenator, and therefore usually be supranormal.\n\nGas tensions in blood from the native CO reflect the function of the respiratory system.\n\nImplies hypoxaemia of blood (predominantly) in the arch vessels\n\nKey tissue beds affected are the heart (via the coronaries), the brain, and the right arm\nLeft SCA and ICA are relatively less affected\n\nOccurs when the:\n\nFunction of the native respiratory system is poor\nSuch that hypoxic blood is return to the LA.\nNative cardiac function is recovering\nSuch that it makes up a reasonable proportion of total cardiac output.\n\nIs affected by the position of the return cannula\nSignificantly ↓ with a central aortic return, as blood should be mixed. Highest risk with a femoral return, as circuit flow favours the caudal regions.\nManagement involves:\n\n↓ native CO\nWean excessive inotropes.\nCorrecting intrapulmonary shunt\n\nPEEP and recruitment\nBronchoscopy\niNO\n\n↑ ECMO flows\nChanging circuit configuration May be indicated if SpO2 &lt;85% despite above therapy.\n\nVV ECMO if cardiac recovery has occurred\nVAV if some ongoing cardiac support required\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection of differential hypoxia is why SpO2 of VA ECMO patients should always be measured on the right arm or ear.\n\n\nWeaning\nWeaning of VA ECMO is more complex than VV ECMO. The process involves:\n\nUnderlying cardiac recovery\nIndicated by ↑ pulsatility with low or no inotropic support.\nConduct of a weaning study:\n\nMonitoring of haemodynamics whilst progressively ↓ circuit flows to 0.5-1L/min\nIncludes echocardiographic assessment\nRequires adequate anticoagulation to prevent sudden oxygenator or pump thrombus due to ↑ stasis\nWeaning studies are limited by the fact that ECMO support is:\n\nNot stopped\nThe last 0.5-1L/min of flow often provides disproportionately high support.\nWeaned only briefly\nUnlike VV ECMO where ECMO support is ceased for hours, ECMO support during a VA wean is reduced only for a short time.\n\n\nSurgical decannulation\nFollowing a successful weaning study, full ECMO flows are restored. Decannulation and actual cessation of support occurs in the OR, as the arterial cannulation sites require formal surgical repair.",

This requires:\n\nRequires a greater-effect site concentration when used alone Typically an effect-site concentration of 7μg/ml is a reasonable starting point in most well adult patients.\n\nCheck to see if the bolus/loading dose given appears reasonable\nReduction can be achieved with another analgesic, consider:\n\nRemifentanil\nNitrous oxide\n\n\nTitration to effect\n\nDepth of anaesthesia monitoring\nLoss of haemodynamic response or limb movement to vigorous jaw thrust\nLoss of haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy\n\nCease infusion once final sutures are applied, before application of dressings\nThe decrement time is useful for timing emergence:\n\nDecrement time set to a Ce at 1.8 appears to be a reliable marker for extubation in children\n\n\nSuggested Cp for propofol TIVA:\n\n\n\nSole Agent\nAdjuncts\n\n\n\n\n4-6μg/ml\n3-4μg/ml\n\n\n\n\n\nPropofol/Remifentanil TIVA for GA\nThis combination:\n\nAllows provision of strong intraoperative analgesia and anaesthesia with a rapid-wake up\nCan be initiated in three ways:\n\nBoth agents with effect-site targeting\nAgents should be started simultaneously.\nEffect-site propofol target with plasma-site remifentanil target\nPropofol will equilibrate with the effect site much more rapidly than remifentanil. Therefore:\n\nA greater dose of propofol will be required, reducing the efficacy of the synergy of these drugs\nStarting the propofol after the remifentanil has equilibrated will achieve a much more rapid induction\n\nPlasma-site propofol target with plasma-site remifentanil target\nIn this instance, remifentanil will equilibrate with the effect site more rapidly. This leads to:\n\nA period of awareness with apnoea\nThis can be overcome with over-pressuring the propofol, but this may lead to adverse CVS effects.\n\n\nCease propofol infusion once final sutures applied\nRemifentanil infusion can be:\n\nCeased with the propofol infusion\nCeased (e.g. 30 minutes) prior to the end of the case\nWith administration of a long-acting opioid to provide post-operative analgesia.\n\n\nLong-acting may also be given throughout the case to reduce remifentanil requirements and (theoretically) opioid hyperalgesia\nLong-acting should be given ~30-40 minutes prior to ceasing a remifentanil infusion\nA dose of 0.1-0.3mg/kg of morphine can be used.\n\nContinued at a target of 1-2μg/ml for a smooth, cough-free extubation\n\n\nSuggested minimum effect-site concentrations for propofol/remifentanil TIVA in adults:\n\n\n\nAge\nSpontaneously Ventilating\n\n\n\n\n⩽50\nPPF: 4-6μg/ml  Remi: 1-3ng/ml\n\n\n⩾50\nPPF: 2-4ug/ml  Remi: 1-2ng/ml",

    "text": "Chemical Dependence\nDefinitions:\n\nSubstance abuse\nRelated, excessive, or inappropriate use of a mood-altering substance resulting in negative consequences in one or more life areas, and where addiction cannot be diagnosed.\nAddiction\nPrimary, chronic disease of brain reward… leading to a pathological pursuit of reward or relief by substance use. Characterised by an inability to consistently abstain, impaired behavioural control, craving, and impaired recognition of problems with behaviours and interpersonal relationships.\n\n\nRisk Factors\nGeneral:\n\nFamily history of drug abuse\nChildhood abuse\nFamily dysfunction\nMental health disorder\nMale\nExperimenting with drugs/alcohol\nPeers who use drugs\nSense of professional immunity from addiction\n\nSpecific:\n\nDirect contact with drugs\nImmediate availability\nEasy to divert\n\n\n\nClinical Manifestations\n\nDisease process usually well-advanced by the time physical and behavioural changes become noticeable\n\nInside the hospital:\n\nBehavioural\n\nDeteriorating relationships\nMood swings\nPoor reliability\nFrequent change of jobs\n\nClinical\n\nPoor administration and record keeping\n\nUnaccounted for drugs\n\nDisproportionate post-operative pain compared with anaesthetic record\nHigh doses of narcotic used in anaesthesia\nPreference for working alone\nDifficult to find between cases or when on call\nAt hospital when not on call\nRequesting extra shifts\nUnusually willing to take on additional work commitments\nCarrying syringes and ampoules in clothing\nIV equipment in non-clinical places\nWearing of long-sleeved gowns\n\n\nOutside of hospital:\n\nWithdrawal from family, friends, and hobbies\nNeglect and deterioration in appearance\nMood swings\nFatigue, lethargy\nPoor concentration, memory\nFrequent unexplained illnesses\nLegal problems\nFinancial problems\n\n\n\nMandatory Notification\nLaw mandates reporting:\n\nPracticing whilst intoxicated\nSexual misconduct\nPlacing patient at risk through impairment\nPatient at risk through practice which constitutes a significant departure from accepted professional standard\n\n\n\nInvestigation\nProcess will vary:\n\nSufficient evidence will usually mandate immediate investigation\nLack of evidence may need a period of monitoring\nInterviews with senior staff (e.g. nurses)\nPolice involvement if criminal activity\n\nMeeting with the person:\n\nNeeds to be planned in advance\nHave suitable contacts available:\n\nOccupational medicine\nPsychiatry\nANZCA Welfare officer\n\nNotification to provider needs to be followed immediately by meeting\nSupport person should be available.\n\nFamily\nFriend\nColleague\n\nExplain concerns raised about their behaviour\nPresent any evidence\nFactual and unemotional way.\nA non-judgmental approach facilitates a more productive interaction\nResponses:\n\nRelief\n\n\nUsually compliant with suggestions for treatment options\n\nAnger\n\nCommon in those with denial\nShould be offered assessment and opportunity to consent to urine or hair testing\n\n\nPerson should be accompanied from this point on\nSignificant risk of self-harm.\n\n\n\nIntervention\nThree major considerations:\n\nPatient safety\n\nRemove person from list\nReview patients to ensure they are adequately cared for\nFind alternative staff\n\nColleague health\n\nPrivate and confidential\nSignificant reputation and career risk with allegation\n\nStatutory reporting obligations\n\n\n\nRecovery\nIn general:\n\nSustained abstinence occurs in 74-90%\nAnaesthetists similar to general doctors.\nMedian time time to relapse is 2.6 years.\n\nMortality of 13%\n\n\nRe-entry:\n\nAssessment by medical board\nRequires supervision\nLimitation of practice\nRestricted access to drugs\nDrug testing\n\nBlood\nUrine\n\nHair\nHair testing is preferable to verify abstinence due to longer lead time.\n\n\n\n\nAngres Criteria\n\nUsed to stratify likelihood of returning to anaesthesia:\n\nCategory I\nReturn immediately after treatment.\n\nTremendous love for/commitment to anaesthesia\nAccepts and understands the disease\nBonding with AA (or narcotics anonymous) and has a sponsor\nStrong family support\nCommitted to recovery\nBalanced lifestyle\nNo evidence of dual diagnosis, for example, bipolar disorder\nTreatment team, anaesthetic department, and employer support return\n\nCategory II\nPossibility of return.\n\nRelapsed with recovery underway\nDysfunctional but improving family situation\nInvolved, but not bonded with AA/NA\nImproving recovery skills\nSome denial remains\nMood swings without other psychiatric diagnosis\n\nCategory III\nRedirection to another specialty.\n\nProlonged i.v. use\nPrior treatment failure and relapses\nDisease clearly remains active\nWent into anaesthesia for drug access\nDysfunctional family\nNon-compliant with regulatory bodies\nPoor recovery skills and no bonding with AA/NA, no sponsor\nSevere co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis\n\n\n\n\nResources\nIn Australia, resources include:\n\nWelfare of Anaesthetists Special Interest Group Documents\nCovering:\n\nRD 1: Personal Health Strategies\nRD 3: Depression & Anxiety\nRD 5: Critical Incident Support\nRD 13: Impairment in a Colleague\nRD 16: Welfare Issues in the

In general:\n\nWomen wish to be involved in the process\nAbout 30% of information will be retained\nWritten consent is not required\nVerbal consent should be documented.\nTalk between contractions if possible\nInvolve the birth partner, particularly if contractions are continuous\nGood discussion points include:\n\nWhat will happen\nThe position, what they will feel (e.g. skin local), the need to keep still.\nRisk of PDPH\n~1:100.\nRisk of failure/inadequate analgesia\nReplacement required ~1:20.\nRisk of neurological complications\n\n\nTemporary: ~1:5,000\nPermanent: ~1:50,000\nParaplegia: ~1:1,000,000\n\n\nConsider mentioning:\n\nRisk of instrumental delivery\nBack pain\nOver next 1-2 days, but not longterm.\n\n\n\n\nTest and Loading Doses\nThe ideal test dose should:\n\nIdentify intrathecal injection\n\nInject small volumes slowly and titrate to effect\n\nIdentify intravascular injection\nAvoid haemodynamic instability\nGive a slower onset of analgesia\nOptimal onset time is 15 minutes. Rapid onset is associated with ↑ uterine tone and foetal bradycardia.\n\n\nA Good Loading Technique\n\n5ml 0.2% ropivacaine\n\n\nIf intrathecal, should be associated with warm sensation (as with spinal) and rapid analgesia\nAsk the patient if they have a substantial reduction in pain.\nUsing a higher dose (e.g. 10ml) may also lead to early motor block, excessive sensory block, or hypotension\n\n100μg fentanyl\n\nIf intravascular, should be associated with a potent opioid effect (analgesia, narcosis)\n\nFurther 10-15ml 0.2% ropivacaine\nTitrated to achieve desired block height.\n\n\n\nNot-so-good Loading Techniques\n\n2% lignocaine\nAssociated with more motor block.\nAdrenaline\nHeart rate changes with 15-20μg of intravascular adrenaline are not reliably distinguishable from effect of epidural adrenaline, or normal heart rate variability.\nIdentify intravascular injection\nOptions include:\n\nNegative aspiration of blood prior to injection\nAdrenaline 15μg\nNeither sensitive nor specific, as it is associated with an ↑ in HR by ~30bpm for ~30s if intravascular, and ~20-30bpm if epidural. No respone may be seen in β-blocked patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintenance Dosing\n\n\nComplications\n\nThis covers complications unique to the labour epidural. Management of issues of insertion and troubleshooting an inadequate or failing epidural are covered elsewhere.\n\nFoetal Distress\nFoetal distress after an epidural is common, and may be:\n\nDirect\nRelated to effects of epidural drugs on the foetus, as some will be absorbed by the mother and transferred to the foetus. Effects seen depend on the type of drug, but are not clinically significant:\n\nOpioid\nRespiratory depression.\nLA\n\n\nTransient reduced variability\n\n\nIndirect\nRelated to effects on the mother by epidural. Include:\n\nMaternal ↓ BP\nMaternal symptholysis results in reduced uteroplacental perfusion, and foetal ischaemia. Requires correction of BP and intrauterine resuscitation.\nOxytocin/Adrenaline Imbalance\nTheory based on the fact that rapid onset of analgesia results in a rapid fall in the circulating (tocolytic) adrenaline, resulting in unopposed oxytocin stimulation and a subsequent fall in uteroplacental perfusion due to the high intrauterine pressure. Notably, foetal distress does not appear to be ↑ with a CSE, despite the more rapid onset of analgesia with this technique.\nMaternal Positioning\nPosition for epidural may result in foetus compressing cord and reducing perfusion.",

Methods include:\n\nJet (Venturi) Ventilation\nMost common method, and involves high-pressure oxygen delivered through the side port at the proximal end of the scope.\n\nBreaths delivered at 10-20/minute at ⩽50psi\nLower rates facilitate passive exhalation via elastic recoil of lung and chest wall.\nEntrainment of air with oxygen facilitates ventilation and oxygenation\nEnsure there is an avenue of escape for the insufflated air to prevent barotrauma\nMonitor chest rise to prevent excessive VT and gas trapping\nMay be automatic or manual\nHigher risk of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum with manual technique.\n\nHigh Frequency Jet Ventilation\nAutomated system giving low VT breaths at a rate of 60-300/min.\n\nMotionless operating field\nDifficult to assess adequacy of ventilation\nMay require repeated blood gas analysis.\nVT &lt; V~Dead Space~\nGas transport mechanisms include laminar flow, longitudinal dispersion, pendelluft, molecular diffusion.\n\nIntermittent Volume ventilation\nVentilation tubing connected to proximal end of bronchoscope.\n\nVentilation provided via the bronchoscope\nLeak minimised by occluding:\n\nBronchoscope ports with silastic caps\nMouth packed with gauze\n\nOcclusion of the mouth and nose may be required to prevent leak\nOnly provides intermittent viewing by the proceduralist\n\nContinuous insufflation/Apnoeic oxygenation\nContinually flow of fresh gas via the side-port.

Systems that emphasise utilitarian approaches, or only account for previously expressed wishes of the donor (disregarding family input) have some donations in category I and II.\nThe nature of DCD donation creates additional complexities:\n\n\nAcceptable warm ischaemic times vary depending on the organ:\n\nLiver, pancreas: &lt;30 minutes warm ischaemic time\nHeart: &lt;30 minutes from SBP &lt;90 mmHg to cold perfusion\nKidneys: &lt;60 minutes functional warm ischaemic time\nLungs: &lt;90 minute functional warm ischaemic time\n\n\nWarm ischaemic time\nPeriod during which the organs are still warm and consuming oxygen, but hypoperfused and ischaemic.

Pip will be ↑ but alveolar pressures will be significantly ↓ due to the airway obstruction. Once ventilation is established, Pplat should be assessed with an inspiratory hold and should be maintained at &lt;25cmH2O.\n\nHaemodynamic deterioration following intubation is often due to dynamic hyperinflation\nThe ventilator should be disconnected and prolonged (60s) expiration allowed to occur to reduce cardiac compression, before continuing ventilation at a lower rate.\n\n\nB\n\nOxygen\nTarget SpO2 94-98%. Excessive supplementation likely harmful.\nBronchodilators\n\nInhaled\n\nShort-acting beta-agonists\n\nSalbutamol\n5-10mg nebulised Q2H, or continuously if clinical concern dictates.\nAdrenaline\nFor patients non-responsive to nebulised salbutamol. 5mg nebulised Q2H.\n\nAnticholinergic\n\nIpratropium bromide\n500ug nebulised Q4H.\n\n\nIntravenous\n\nBeta-agonists\nConsider if no response to inhaled beta-agonists.\n\nSalbutamol\n5-10ug/min or 100-250ug bolus in extremis.\nAdrenaline 10ug bolus, with infusion at 1-10ug/min.\n\nCorticosteroids\nMagnesium\nControversial, but probably beneficial in adults and unlikely to be harmful.\n\n5-10mmol IV over ~20 minutes\n\n\nAnaesthetic agents\n\nKetamine\nDirect and indirect (via ↑ sympathetic tone) bronchodilation. Useful as an induction agent for endotracheal intubation or as a component of post-intubation sedation, but not independently of this.\nVolatile\nMany inhaled anaesthetic agents (sevoflurane, isoflurane, enflurane, halothane) are effective direct bronchodilators, with use limited by requiring an intubated patient and a ventilator capable of administering them.\n\n\nNon-Invasive Ventilation\nPEEP ↓ inspiratory threshold work and may split open small airways, whilst Psup ↓ inspiratory work and ↑ VT and MV.\n\nIndicated for:\n\nModerate-severe dyspnoea or ↑ work of breathing\nRespiratory acidosis\n\nCommence with:\n\nCPAP 5cmH2O\n↑ If difficulty initiating inspiration.\nPsup 8-10cmH2O\n↑ If low Vt/ RR.\n\nTarget VT ~7mL/kg, RR ~25\n\nVV ECMO\nMay be required if oxygenation is unable to be managed effectively following intubation.\n\n\n\n\nTo initiate gas flow into the lungs, the patient must generate enough inspiratory force such that Palv &lt; Patm.\n\nIf iPEEP is high, then a very negative intrapleural pressure must be generated before Palv is less than Patm and inspiration commences. Application of external PEEP reduces this gradient, and therefore reduces the amount of work performed before inspiration commences (inspiratory threshold work).\n\nNote that this differs from the controlled ventilation settings, because NIV assumes spontaneous breathing. Inspiratory threshold work is irrelevant in fully controlled ventilation.\nSpecific therapy:\n\nPharmacological\nCommunity management of asthma is a cornerstone of preventing severe exacerbations. Agents used include:\n\nInhaled “preventers”\nUsually one (or combination therapy) of:\n\nLong-acting beta-agonists\ne.g. Salmeterol.\nInhaled corticosteroids\ne.g. Fluticasone.\n\nLeukotriene antagonists\n\nPhysical\n\nAsthma management plan\n\n\nDisposition:\n\nIntensive care admission is recommended for:\n\nSevere asthma\nRespiratory arrest\nAltered mental state\nDysrhythmias\nMyocardial ischaemia\n\n\n\nMarginal and Ineffective Therapies\n\nAminophylline\nInferior bronchodilator relative to others available, with a narrow therapeutic range and poor side effect profile.\nHeliox\n70% helium/30% oxygen mixture improves work of breathing and effect of inhaled bronchodilators. This is limited by availability of heliox and the low delivered FiO2.",

Considerations:\n\nThe disease and degree of recruitable lung is highly heterogenous and often over-distension and under-recruitment will occur together\nHigher PEEP is associated with better outcomes in more severe disease, and worse outcomes in milder disease\nInadequate PEEP tends to cause under-recruitment and hypoxia\nExcessive PEEP tends to cause over-distension, ↑ lung stress, and reduced cardiac output\nIdeally, PEEP maintains lung volume at FRC thereby:\n\nMaximally recruiting available alveoli\nSpreading VT over a greater number of alveoli\nReducing Pip\nDeceasing Barotrauma and volutrauma\n\n\nAppropriate FiO2\nHigh FiO2 is associated with diffuse alveolar damage. FiO2 should be titrated (in combination with PEEP adjustment):\n\nDown to &lt;0.6 (as able)\nAiming SpO2 &gt;90%\n\nPermissive hypercapnoea\n\nAvoid:\n\nVolutrauma\nAimVT4-6mL/kg predicted body weight.\nBarotrauma\nAim Pplat &lt;30cmH2O.\n\nThe plateau pressure is a substitute for the transpulmonary pressure, which reflects the actual elastic distending pressure of the lung\n\nMeasurement of the transpulmonary pressure can be performed with an oesophageal balloon, which allows the chest wall and lung elastance to be separated (rather than measuring the elastance of the respiratory system as a whole)\n\nThis may be still be excessive (or inadequate) in patients at extremes of chest wall elastance\n\n\n\nNeuromuscular blockade\n\nNo evidence of benefit for routine use\nAppropriate for:\n\nVentilator dyssynchrony despite deep sedation\nVery poor lung compliance preventing lung protective ventilation\n\nAdvantages\n\n↓ PTHx rate\nPredicate of proning\n\nDisadvantages\n\nRequires deep sedation\n↑ Haemodynamic instability\n\n\niNO\nAppropriate to trial for hypoxaemia refractory to traditional ventilation, for:\n\nShort periods\nAs a bridge to proning or ECMO\n\nVV ECMO\n\nE\n\nEarly mobilisation\n\nG\n\nStress ulcer prophylaxis\nFeeding\n\nH\n\nDVT prophylaxis\n\n\n\n\nOne reasonable approach to PEEP-setting is identifying the level where DO2 (i.e., the product of arterial oxygen content and cardiac output) is maximal. Determining this point at the bedside is, of course, difficult.\nDisposition:\n\nMarginal and Ineffective Therapies\n\nHigh-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation\n↑ Mortality compared to lung protective ventilation strategies.\nRecruitment manoeuvres\nRecruitment improves oxygenation by ↑ number of ventilated alveoli. However, following a recruitment manoeuvre:\n\nOver-inflation of previously normal lung occurs\nMay be harmful.\nOxygenation may improve\nPredominantly early ARDS with a lower baseline PEEP.\nHaemodynamic instability may occur\nDue to large changes in VR.\n\n\n\n\nRecruitment manoeuvres are covered in more detail under Recruitment.",

This mirrors the response seen in LV disease, and occurs in phases:\n\nHomeometric adaptation\nAdaptive hypertrophy that leads to ↑ contractility and preservation of SV.\nHeterometric adaptation\nTransition to maladaptive changes, with:\n\n↓ β-receptor density\nFailure of cAMP stimulation\nVasodilation\nFall in EF requires ventricular enlargement to maintain stroke volume. As in LV disease, this indicates decompensation.\n\nDysoxia\nProgressive hypertrophy ↑ O2 demand; when this exceeds supply contractility furhter declines and ventriculoarterial uncoupling occurs.\n\nNeurohormonal activation\nFibrosis\nCollagen proliferation occurs due to mechanical stress, ischaemia, and neuromormonal activation. This results in impaired luisotropy and diastolic dysfunction.\nIschaemia\n\nKey haemodynamic principles include:\n\n\nWith (particularly acute) RV failure, RVEDP rises and RV perfusion pressure is reduced due to a higher downstream pressure. Similar physiology is seen during pulmonary hypertension, as the high RVSP reduces RV perfusion during ventricular systole.\n\nCoronary perfusion pressure of &lt;30mmHG is associated with severe reduction in myocardial blood flow, leading to ischaemia and significant RV dysfunction. This leads to the “Right Ventricular Spiral of Death”, where RV dysfunction leads to ↓ LV preload, which in turn causes a ↓ LV SV, a ↓ MAP, and further RV impairment.\n\nPreload\nThe RV is thin-walled and compliant, and in normal circumstances is able to tolerate significant variability in preload. However:\n\nExcessive ↑ preload displaces the interventricular septum leftwards, and so impair LV function\n\n\nThis further impairs the RV by ↓ perfusion\nThis effect is more pronounced with pre-existing RV dysfunction\n\nChronic ↑ in preload results in:\n\nRV dilation and loss of contractile reserve\nVenous congestion of the whole body capillary bed\n↓ Perfusion to all organ systems.\n\n\nAfterload\nThe RV is thin walled and weak, and is highly sensitive to changes in afterload.\n\nChanges in symptomatology therefore usually mirror changes in afterload\nAcute ↑ afterload can rapidly lead to circulatory collapse\nThe prime determinant of RV afterload is pulmonary vascular impedance, and all determinants are intra-thoracic\n\nPerfusion pressure\nThe RV usually perfuses throughout the cardiac cycle, although in disease (with an ↑ in RVEDP) this may fall, ↑ the sensitivity of the RF to hypotension.\n\n\n\n\\(RV \\ Coronary \\ Perfusion \\ Pressure = P_{Aortic Root} - P_{RV}\\)\n\nAetiology",

    "text": "Management\n\nManagement of AF has traditionally been divided into two competing strategies:\n\nRate control\nRemain in AF, with controlled ventricular rate. Requires anticoagulation.\nRhythm control\nConversion to sinus rhythm. May be superior to rate control, if it can be achieved, and is desirable in patients:\n\n&lt;60\nStructurally normal hearts\nReversible precipitant of AF\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate/rhythm control debate is made more complex by the fact that rate control strategies result in SR in ~35% of patients, and rhythm control fails in 40-60% of patients. Rhythm control agents (amiodarone, flecainide) also have poorer side effect profiles than rate control agents.\n\nOverall, rhythm control is probably superior if it can be consistently achieved without requirement for heavy-duty antiarrhythmics; and so is most ideal in a young patient, without structural heart disease, and good cardiac reserve.\nResuscitation:\n\nRhythm control\n\nSpecific Therapy:\n\nPharmacological\n\nHaemodynamic control\nOne of:\n\nRhythm control\nRate control\n\nAnticoagulation\n\nProcedural\n\nAblation\nAchieves drug-free rhythm control in &gt;80% after one attempt, and &gt;90% after two attempts.\nLAA occlusion\nLAA ligation\nLeft pericardiotomy\nMAZE\n\n\n\n\nLAA ligation, left pericardiotomy, and MAZE all are performed as an addition to another cardiac surgery to prevent post-operative AF, and are not performed as singular procedures.\nSupportive Care:\n\nTreat precipitant\n\n\nRhythm Control\n\nUrgent electrical cardioversion is recommended for haemodynamically unstable AF with RVR - just as with other unstable tachyarrhythmias.\n\nCardioversion describes restoration of normal sinus rhythm, and is associated with a temporary ↑ stroke risk, as any clot formed in the static atria may embolise when atrial contraction resumes. Risk significantly elevated if both:\n\nNot therapeutically anticoagulated for at least 3 weeks\nAF duration &gt;48 hours\n\nCardioversion can be performed either:\n\nElectrically\nSynchronised electrical cardioversion indicated if haemodynamically unstable.

Subtypes of adrenal insufficiency vary with their features:\n\nPrimary adrenal insufficiency is the only cause that produces hyperpigmentation\nOnly form with ↑ ACTH production.\nSecondary adrenal insufficiency typically does not result in substantial mineralocorticoid deficiency, and remains a primarily cortisone-deficient state\n\n\nFeatures of Adrenal Insufficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific to Cortisone Deficiency\nSpecific to Aldosterone Deficiency\nNon-specific\n\n\n\n\n\nHypotension\nRefractory to fluids and vasopressors.\nHypoglycaemia\nEosinophilia\nHyperpigmentation\nDue to ↑ ACTH, which stimulates melanogenesis.

vs. 49%, RR 0.88 (CI 0.78 - 0.99))\nSecondary outcomes broadly favour steroids\n\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C:\n\nThe rationale for Vitamin C is that:\n\nLevels are ↓ in the critically ill\nOxidative stress is ↑ in the critically ill\nVitamin C has antioxidant effects that may alleviate some oxidative stress\n\nMarik et al (2017)\n\n47 non-pregnant Americans with severe sepsis or septic shock and pro-calcitonin &gt;2ng/mL\nSingle-centre, retrospective, observational study\nVitamin C 1.5g QID (7 days), hydrocortisone 50mg QID (4 days, then 3 day taper), and thiamine 200mg BD (4 days)

English-speaking adults mechanically enilated patients with ARDS and suspected or proven infection with ⩾2 SIRS criteria\nRandomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-centre (7)\nVitamin C (50mg/kg) vs. placebo\nNo significant difference in SOFA score, CRP, or thrombomodulin\nSecondary outcomes indicate ↓ 28 day mortality (28% vs 46%), ICU-free days to day 28, and hospital-free days to day 60 in the vitamin C group\n\nVITAMINS (2020)\n\nAdults admitted with Septic Shock, not at imminent risk of death\nMulticentre pilot RCT performed based on the now-infamous Marik study\nRandomised

sets of cultures taken 30-240 minutes after antibiotics\nSignificant ↓ in positive cultures post antibiotics\n\n~30% positive pre-antibiotic, compared to ~20% positive post-antibiotic\nRRR ~33%.\nMore pronounced ↓ in positive post-antibiotic cultures if organism was sensitive to antibiotic used\nRRR ~50%.\nPositive post-antibiotic cultures were associated with ↑ time to positivity, suggesting ↑ bacterial burden\n\n\nCandiSep (2022)\n\n342 Adults with sepsis at risk of invasive candidiasis, but without proven fungal infection and not on fungal treatment\nBlood cultures performed and randomised to:\n\n(1→3)-β-D-Glucan testing performed on blood cultures\nFungal cell wall component that can be detected prior to cultures becoming positive.\nStandard cultures\n\nβ-D-Glucan group
