# Liver Function Tests

Liver function tests are a panel consisting of most of:

* **Bilirubin**\
End product of haeme metabolism. It is conjugated in the liver, so we can measure:
	* Unconjugated bilirubin\
	↑ Indicates either ↑ bilirubin production or ↓ hepatic conjugation.
	* Conjugated bilirubin\
	↑ Indicates normal hepatic conjugation and failure of secretion.
* γ-Glutamyl transferase (**GGT**)\
Inducible enzyme produced predominantly in the biliary tract. Highly non-specific.
* Alkaline Phosphatase (**ALP**)\
Ubiquitous enzyme, found predominantly in on the surface of bile canaliculi, bone (during formation), intestine, and placenta.
* Aspartate Aminotransferase (**AST**)\
Kreb cycle enzyme, present in many tissues but most concentrated in:
	* **Hepatocytes**
	* **Muscle**\
	↑ In rhabdomyolysis and MI.
* Alanine Transaminase (**ALT**)\
Kreb cycle enzyme, used to turn alanine into pyruvate. Present in (essentially) all cells, but abundant in hepatocytes. ALT is:
	* Released after AST
	* Rises higher and longer than AST
	* Usually lower if alcohol is the cause\
\
* **Albumin**\
Hepatically synthesised plasma protein, half-life of ~20 days.
* **Total protein**\
Sum of all plasma proteins (not all hepatically synthesised), including: albumin, immunoglobulins, and carrier proteins.

As a good rule of thumb, AST will be higher than ALT in ischaemia, toxins, and alcohol, and alcohol will not have an AST >400.
