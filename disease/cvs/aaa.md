#Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

Permanent dilatation **>30mm** of the aorta.

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Risk factors include:
* Family history
* Smoking  
Most important modifiable risk factor - cessation reduces growth by 15-20%.
* Race  
Increased in caucasians.

Size correlates strongly with risk of rupture:
* Aneurysms >5.5 cm have an 18% annual rupture risk in women, and 12% in men


##Pathophysiology
###Aetiology
##Assessment
###History
###Examination
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
Surgical management:
* Indicated when aneurysm is **greater than 5.5cm**
* May be open or endovascular
	* Equivalent long-term outcome

###Anaesthetic Considerations
###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
Non-surgically treated patients die of rupture in **80% of cases**:
* ~80% 5-year risk of rupture
* Surgical management may double life expectancy


Operative complications are associated with:
* Age
* Decreased renal function
* Decreased FEV<sub>1</sub>
* Being female
