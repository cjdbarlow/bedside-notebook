# Aortic Stenosis

Aortic stenosis occurs when valvular disease impedes blood flow across the valve during ventricular systole. The aortic valve is normally 2.6-3.5cm^2^, and haemodynamically significant obstruction occurs when AVA approaches 1cm^2^. The degree of stenosis is classified based on echocardiographic findings, using either:

* Aortic valve pressure gradient/peak flow
	* Pressure gradients are calculated by measuring flow across the valve, using the **simplified Benoulli equation:** $\Delta P = 4v^2$
	* Peak gradients are calculated from peak flow during ejection
	* Mean gradients are calculated by the average flow (area under the doppler envelope) during ejection
* Aortic valve area\
Derived using AV VTI, LVOT VTI, and LVOT area.
* Dimensionless Index\
Ratio of the LVOT VTI to the AV VTI, and therefore an area-independent measurement.

: Grading of Aortic Stenosis

| Technique              | Mild     | Moderate | Severe |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| Peak velocity (m/s)    | 2.6-2.9  | 3-4      | \>4    |
| Mean Pressure Gradient | <20      | 20-40    | \>40   |
| Aortic Valve Area      | \>1.5    | 1.5-1.0  | <1.0   |
| Dimensionless Index    | 0.5-0.75 | 0.25-0.5 | <0.25  |

:::column-margin
Pressure gradients are dependent upon flow across the valve, and may **under-predict severity in failure states** because the failing LV cannot generate enough pressure to produce a high flow.

**Low-flow, low-gradient AS** is:

* Suggested by an impaired EF (<50%) and *discordance* between the MPG and AVA, i.e.:
	* AVA <1cm^2^
	* MPG <40mmHg
* Divided into two types:
	* True severe AS with impaired EF
		* ↑ Gradient with dobutamine challenge
		* Benefits from AVR
	* Pseudo AS
		* No change in gradient but ↑ in AVA with dobutamine challenge
		* Does not benefit from AVR
		* Benefits from medical management

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Risk factors include:

* Male
* CAD risk factors
	* DM
	* Hypercholesterolaemia
	* Smoking
	* Hypertension
	* Haemodialysis\
	Occurs in 10%.

## Pathophysiology

In aortic stenosis:

:::column-margin
Fixed outflow tract obstructions with valvular AS or presence of a sub-aortic membrane. Dynamic outflow tract obstruction typically occurs with HOCM.
:::

* There is a constant degree of fixed outflow tract obstruction
* LV responds to obstruction by undergoing hypertrophy\
Allows pressure gradient across the valve to be maintained without:
	* Reduction in SV
	* Ventricular dilation
* LVH leads to impaired compliance and diastolic dysfunction\
	* Hypertrophied ventricle more dependent on atrial kick
* LVH ↑ oxygen requirements, whilst ↑ LV diastolic pressures reduce coronary blood flow and oxygen delivery\
Susceptible to ischaemia, especially when CO is high, even in absence of coronary artery disease.
* LA hypertrophy/dilation may occur to maintain filling


### Aetiology

AS may be caused by:

* Degenerative calcification\
Mechanical stress leading to progressive fibrosis and calcification.
	* Most common cause
	* Typically in those over 70
	* Initially occurs as sclerosis\
	Thickening/calcification of leaflets without stenosis.
* Congenital bicuspid valve\
Most common congenital cardiac malformation.
	* Typically symptomatic in 40-60 year olds\
	Accounts for 50% of AVR performed for AS in those under 70.


## Assessment

Aortic stenosis typically has:

* A long symptom-free period\
Low morbidity and mortality over this period.
* Variable onset of symptoms, depending on aetiology and degree of degeneration
	* Rheumatic: 40-50
	* Congenitally bicuspid: 15-65
	* Degenerative: 70-90


### History

* Angina\
Due to mismatch between LV oxygen consumption and demand.
* Syncope\
Late and bad sign. Occurs due to inadequate cardiac output, and may be related to either:
	* ↑ demand in the setting of a relatively fixed cardiac output
	* Arrhythmia
* Dyspnoea\
Due to LV failure, and typically occurs in late disease (as it represents a failure of LV compensation.)

### Examination

* Slow rising, low volume pulse
* Reduced SBP and pulse pressure
* Ejection systolic murmur
	* Peaks in late systole
	* Radiates to carotids and to apex
	* May disappear in LV failure as flow through the valve orifice ↓

### Investigations

**Bedside**:

* Diagnostic TTE\
Diagnostic and essential for risk stratification. Features include:
	* Thickening
	* Impaired mobility
	* Congenital abnormalities
	* Calcification of valve leaflets
* ECG
	* Normal in ~20%
	* LAD
	* LVH\
	* AV block\
	Secondary to AV nodal calcium infiltration (extending from the aortic annulus).

**Laboratory**:

**Imaging**:

**Other**:

* Dobutamine stress echo\
Used in the setting with ↓ EF and apparent severe AS, to distinguish true AS from pseudo-AS.
	* Addition of inotrope improves LV function
	* If the AVA is low solely due to poor LV function, then the improved VTI (with inotrope) ↑ AVA and the MPG remains similar
	* If the AVA is low due to true stenosis, then the AVA does not improve (the valve is stenosed), and the MPG ↑ substantially


### Diagnostic Approach and DDx



## Management

:::priority
:::

:::column-margin
**Asymptomatic patients** should be monitored for progression of AS or deteriorating LV function that would indicate requirement for AVR.
:::

**Resuscitation**:

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
* Procedural
	* Surgical AVR
	* TAVI
	* BAV\
	Reserved for patients too high risk for surgery and inappropriate for TAVI. Results in regurgitation and risk of early restenosis.
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:


### Anaesthetic Considerations

:::caution
Assume a hypertrophied and non-compliant ventricle.
:::

:::column-margin
In mixed valvular disease, management should prioritise the most haemodynamically significant lesion. That said, in general:

{{< include /includes/as_mr.qmd >}}
{{< include /includes/as_ms.qmd >}}
{{< include /includes/as_mr.qmd >}}
:::

* C
	* Lesion assessment\
	Preoperative TTE ideal to evaluate degree of stenosis and LV function.
		* If unable to evaluate preoperatively, treat as if patient has at least moderate severity disease
		* Impairment can be estimated by knowing that valve area reduces by ~0.1cm^2^/year
	* Invasive arterial monitoring
	* **Defend**:
		* **Preload**\
		Poor ventricular compliance requires filling, therefore aim:
			* Sinus rhythm\
			Aggressively manage tachyarrhythmias.
			* Low-normal (50-70) **heart rate**\
			Adequate time for ventricular filling.
			* Euvolaemia
		* **Perfusion pressure**\
			* Vasopressor infusions with aggressive use of boluses to maintain afterload
			* Use neuraxial techniques with caution


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

Extensive cardiac remodelling, including:

* LVH
* LV diastolic dysfunction
* LA dilation
* MR\
Due to annular dilatation.
* PHTN\


## Prognosis

Asymptomatic severe AS:

* Annual ↓ in AVA is ~0.1cm^2^/year
* Median time to symptom development is 1-4 years
* Within 5 years:
	* 2/3^rds^ will develop symptoms
	* 75% will have died or had valve replacement


Symptomatic severe AS:

* Very poor prognosis without AVR
* Mortality rapidly ↑ once symptoms develop\
	* Mean survival 0.5-2.8 years after onset of cardiac failure
	* Mean survival 0.8-3.8 years after onset of syncope
	* Mean survival 2-4.7 years after onset of angina
* Pulmonary hypertension is an additional risk factor and worsens prognosis after valve replacement


Perioperative death and MI risk:

* Symptomatic AS; OR 2.7
* Co-existing moderate or severe MR; OR 9.8
* Pre-existing CAD; OR 2.7
