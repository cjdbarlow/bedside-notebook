#Air Embolism


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Risk factors for venous air embolism:
* Open veins above the RA
	* Position dependent
	* Some veins may be tethered open, greatly increasing risk:
		* **Bone**  
		* Dura
* CVP  
High CVP is protective.

##Pathophysiology
Air in the pulmonary circulation leads to:
* Increased PVR  
Secondary to obstruction and reflexive hypoxic vasoconstriction.
* Shunt  
Interstitial/pulmonary oedema due to local inflammation.


###Aetiology
##Clinical Manifestations
>~3-5ml/kg of entrained air may cause cardiac arrest, although effect depends both on total volume and rate of entrainment

VAE may be graded by its clinical severity:
* Small  
⩽10ml.
	* Only visible on TOE
	* Nil CVS compromise
* Moderate  
10-50ml.
	* ↑ HR and ↑ BP  
	Due to ↑ SNS tone.
	* ↑ PAP
	* ↓ E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>  
	Due to shunt. A drop in end-tidal is **always significant**.
	* Bubbles visibile on TOE
* Large  
⩾50ml.
	* ↓ BP due to obstructive shock
	* ↑ Or ↓ in HR
	* ↑ CVP due to RV failure  
	* Signs of RV strain/dysrhythmia.
	* Cardiac arrest may occur



###History
###Examination
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
* TOE

##Management
Basing on grading:
* Small  
Identify cause and eliminate it. Warn surgeon.
* Moderate  
As small, and:
	* Apply 100% oxygen
	* Cease nitrous oxide
	* Haemodynamic management  
	Generally right heart support with vasopressor.
	* Consider abandoning procedure if paradoxical embolism is possible
	* Consider aspirating CVC if one is present
* Large  
As moderate, and:
	* Consider **hyperbaric oxygen**

###Anaesthetic Considerations
In high-risk situations, consider preemptive **protective management**:
* Volume loading
	* 10ml/kg 4% albumin
	* Neck *venous* tourniquet
* Avoid Valsalva  
May increase right-to-left shunting in the presence of a foramen ovale, leading to paradoxical embolism.


###Ineffective Therapies
* Air aspiration
	* Generally ineffective
	* More effective with specially designed multi-orifice catheters, but these will generally need to be placed prior to the embolism occurring
