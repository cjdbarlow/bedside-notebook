#Aortic Dissection

Aortic dissections are:
* A tear of the aortic intima
	* Entry of blood between the media and the intima
	* Expansion of a **false lumen** that expands proximally and distally
	* Organ ischaemia due to occlusion of vessels from the false lumen
* Have multiple classification systems, including:
	* DeBakey Classification  
	Classified based on anatomical origin and extent.
		* Type I
			* Begins in the ascending aorta
			* Extends past the aortic arch  
			May extend to the iliacs.
		* Type II
			* Begins in the ascending aorta
			* Ends in the ascending aorta
		* Type III  
		Subdivided into:
			* IIIa
				* Begin distal to the L SCA
				* Does not extend past the diaphgram
			* IIIb
				* Begin distal to the L SCA
				* Extend past the diaphragm
	* Stanford Classification  
	Also based on anatomical origin
		* Type A  
		Originate in the ascending aorta.
			* Mortality of 1-2% per hour after onset
		* Type B  
		Originate in the descending aorta, but may propagate proximally.
			* May be medically managed  
			Control of HR and BP.

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Key risk factors:
* CVS disease
	* Hypertension
	* Hyperlipidaemia
	* Smoking
* Cocaine use
* Pregnancy  
Generally 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester or post-partum.


##Pathophysiology
###Aetiology
May be:
* Degenerative
* Genetic disease  
Diseases of connective tissue:
	* Marfans Syndrome
	* Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
	* Familial Aortic Dissection
	* Annuloaortic ectasia
* Iatrogenic
	* Cardiac surgery
	* Cardiac catheterisation
	* IABP insertion

##Assessment
Presentations include:
* **Chest and back pain**  
Rapid onset, severe.
* May be **painless** in **6%**  
Generally:
	* Diabetic
	* History of AAA
	* History of cardiac surgery
* Cardiac failure
* CVA
* Syncope

##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
Include:
* CT
* TOE

##Management
Follows an ABC approach:
* Destination
	* ICU
	* OR
* A
* B
* C
	* Bilateral invasive blood pressure monitoring
	* Large bore IV access
	* Aggressive HR and BP control  
	Using β-blockers and vasodilators.
		* SBP 100-120mmHg
		* HR ⩽60bpm
