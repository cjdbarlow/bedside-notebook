#Pulmonary Embolism

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Risk factors for clot formation via Vichows triad:
* Stasis  
Many thrombi occur around venous valves.
	* Advanced age  
	Risk increases after 40.
	* Immobilisation
	* Obesity
	* General anaesthesia  
	~30-50% greater risk compared to spinal/regional technique.
* Endothelial Damage
	* Central venous access
* Hypercoagulable state
	* Surgery  
	Incidence depends on type of surgery:
		* Thoracic: ~2%
		* Abdominal: ~1%
		* Hip arthroplasty: Up to 30%
		* Knee arthroplasty: Up to 7%
		* Trauma: 2-6%
		* Neurosurgery: Up to 4%
		* Spinal cord injury: 5-9%
	* Hereditary
		* AT III deficiency
		* Protein C or S deficiency
		* Factor V leiden
		* Prothrombin gene deficiency
	* Pregnancy  
	DVT risk is 5x as high post-partum compared with durign pregnancy, and PE risk is 15x as high.
	* Malignancy
	* Acute illness
		* Trauma
		* Sepsis
	* Inflammatory diseases
		* IBD
	* Previous VTE
	* Drugs
		* OCP  
		2-5x increased relative risk.
		* Chemotherapeutics
		* Smoking
		* Antipsychotics


Risk factors for death from PE:
* Age > 70
* Congestive heart failure
* COAD
* ASA score
* Hypotension and tachypnoea on diagnosis

##Pathophysiology
Clot burden:
* Thrombi commonly form in the deep veins of the leg  
Clot can then:
	* Propagate proximally  
	PE will occur in ~50% of patients with proximal DVT.
	* Break off entirely  
	~20% of patients with PE have no identified DVT.


Changes in pulmonary gas exchange:
* Increased alveolar dead space  
Non-perfused alveoli distal to clot.
* Over-perfusion of non-clotted lung  
May cause shunt via a variety of mechanisms:
	* Oedema
	* Pulmonary haemorrhage  
	Pulmonary infarction does not usually occur due to ongoing perfusion from bronchial circulation.
	* Loss of surfactant
	* Vasoactive peptide secretion



Changes in cardiac function:
* Increased PVR  
Due to low mixed venous PO<sub>2</sub> in patients with PE and low-cardiac output states.
* Elevated right-sided pressures  
Increase in RAP may open a PFO and lead to intracardiac right-to-left shunting.


##Clinical Manifestations
Clinical features depend on:
* Clot location
* Clot burden
* Severity of disease relating to underlying CVS reserve

Features include:
* Due to pulmonary infarction
	* Haemoptysis
	* Pleuritic chest pain  
	* Pleural rub  


* Due to pulmonary hypertension
	* RV pressure overload
		* Increased RAP  
		May be seen as elevated JVP.
		* Increased PVR
		* Decreased CO
		* Increased SVR
	* Loud P<sub>2</sub>

* Due to obstructive shock:
	* Cardiac arrest
	* Shock Index > 1 is strongly associated with in hospital mortality
	* Tachycardia  
	May be isolated finding.
	Tachypnoea
	* Hypotension



###History
###Examination
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
PE should always be considered in patients with:
* Sudden onset syncope
* Hypotension
* Extreme hypoxia
* EMD
* Cardiac arrest


Assessing a patient who *may* have PE should:
* Commence with careful evaluation of history, risk factors, and physical exam
* Use a validated clinical prediction score to stratify need for further investigations
	* Wells Score
	* Geneva score


##Investigations
Can be divided into:
* Non-diagnostic tests
* Diagnostic tests


###Non-Diagnostic Tests
ECG may demonstrate:
* No abnormalities
* Isolated sinus tachycardia
* Atrial arrythmias  
Associated with higher mortality.
* Repolarisation abnormalities  
Present in ~50% of PE patients.
* RBBB and precordial TWI best correlate with severity
* RV strain/cor pulmonale  
Also non-specific, but suggest massive embolism rather than smaller emvoli.
	* S1Q3T3
	* P-pulmonale
	* Incomplete RBBB
	* RAD


Bloods:
* D-Dimer
	* ~97% sensitive  
	May be useful in ruling out PE in patients with low to moderate clinical suspicion.
		* Reduces the need for radiological tests
	* Non-specific  
	Does not support diagnosis or indicate severity.
* Troponin  
	* Elevated in <50% of patients
	* Associated with adverse outcomes  
	Death, inotropes.
* ABG  
Typically demonstrates:
	* Hypoxaemia  
	May be only abnormality in smaller PEs.
	* Respiratory alkalosis


Echocardiography may identify:
* Presence of thrombus  
~26% of severe PE can be seen on TOE.
* Other disease
* Signs of RV dysfunction  
Findings include:
	* RV/LV end-diastolic diameter ratio > 0.7
	* RV/LV area ratio > 0.66
	* RV end-diastolic diameter > 27mm
	* "McConnel Sign"  
	RV fre wall hypokinesis with RV apex normo or hyperkinesis.
	* Septal shift
	* TR jet >270cm/sec.


CXR:
* Useful in supporting or ruling-out other causes of hypoxaemia and hypotension
* Required prior to V/Q scan


Physiological dead space:
* Almost always increased in the case of PE  
Formal measurement is:
	* 100% sensitive
	* 89% specific
* Requires an intubated/ventilated patient
* Not easy to perform in practice
* Suggested by
	* Acute reduction in ETCO<sub>2</sub>
	* Delay in reaching alveolar plateau on ETCO<sub>2</sub> waveform


###Diagnostic Tests
Include:
* CTPA
	* Quicker and more available than V/Q scanning, but requires contrast load
	* ~85% sensitive  
	Varies depending on machine and radiologist.
		* Increases to ~100% of PEs with haemodynamic instability
		* Commonly identifies PE in asymptomatic patients
* VQ scan
	* May not be appropriate if existing cardio-pulmonary disease
	* Sensitivity increased with modern SPECT devices  
	~1% now non-diagnostic.
	* More sensitive than CTPA for peripheral emboli


##Management
###Prophylaxis
Preventative methods include:
* Mechanical
	* Intermittent pneumatic calf compression  
	May reduce incidence by up to 60% in operative patients.
		* Treatment of choice where bleeding risk is high
	* IVC filters
		* No evidence for mortality reduction
		* Increased risk of DVT  
		Should be retrieved when no longer required.
		* Reasonable to use in patients with:
			* High VTE risk and contraindications to anticoagulation
			* Recurrent PE despite therapeutic anticoagulation
* Pharmacological


###Therapeutic
* Supportive care
	* May be required prior to formal diagnosis
	* Aim to improve RV function
		* Noradrenaline is the vasopressor of choice
		* Adrenaline is a reasonable alternative
		* Pulmonary vasodilators
			* iNO
		* Volume is deleterious if the RV is distended  
		Further volume will further distend the RV and reduce LV preload.


* Anticoagulation  
Inhibit extension of the clot, allowing intrinsic fibrinolysis to decrease clot burden.
	* Improves survival in patients with symptomatic PE  
	May be reasonable to commence prior to formal diagnosis if bleeding risk is low.
	* Options include:
		* UFH
		* LMWH  
		Superior to UFH in most setttings.
		* Warfarin  
		Reasonable when haemodynamic and bleeding risk is stabilised.


* Clot retreival


* Thrombolysis  
Risk outweighs benefits in most patients.
	* ~50% reduction in mortality in massive PE
	* ~50% (and greater absolute increase) in risk of major bleeding
		* ~3% of thrombolysed patients will develop ICH
	* May be appropriate in patients with haemodynamic compromise and not judged to be at a high risk of bleeding
		* e.g. Proven PE with cardiogenic shock


* Pulmonary embolectomy  
Open surgical technique involving removal of clot from the pulmonary arteries. Requires CPB.
	* High perioperative mortality
	* Reasonable if thrombolysis is contraindicated


###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications

* Death
	* 25-30% of patients with RV failure requiring inotropes
	* Up to 13% of perioperative PEs
* Recurrence
	* ~6% within 6 months  
	Despite therapeutic anticoagulation.
	* ~8% with 12 months
* Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension
* Postthrombotic syndrome
