#Chiari Malformations

Family of disorders characterised by anomalies cranio-cervical junction and downward displacement of the cerebellar contents. Divided into 4 types:
* Chiari Type I
	* Tonsillar herniation >5mm below the foramen magnum
	* No associated brainstem herniation or supratentorial anomalies
	* Low frequency of hydrocephalus
	* Often diagnosed in adulthood or adolescence
* Chiari Type II (Arnold-Chiari Malformation)
	* Caudal herniation of the vermis, brainstem, and 4<sup>th</sup> ventricle
	* Associated with:
		* Myelomengingocele
		* Brain anomalies
		* Hydrocephalus
		* Syringomyelia
	* Usually diagnosed prenatally or at birth
* Chiari Type III
	* Occipital encephalocele  
	Containing dysmorphic cerebellar and brainstem tissues.
	* High mortality in infancy  	
	Due to respiratory failure.
* Chiari Type IV
	* Hypoplastic or aplastic cerebellum


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
##Pathophysiology
###Aetiology
##Assessment
May be asymptomatic.

Clinical features include:
* Cranial nerve palsies
* Syringomyelia
* Myelopathy
* Cerebellar symptoms
* Neck pain
* Occipital headache

##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
Diagnosis is based upon imaging alone.

##Investigations
Imaging:
* CT
* MRI

##Management
Medical management focuses on:
* Respiratory failure
* Feeding difficulties
* Neurogenic bowel
* Neurogenic bladder

Surgery:
* Aims to decompress cranio-cervical junction and restore normal CSF flow across the foramen magnum

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* A
	* Atlanto-axial instability
* D
	* ICP  
	Hydrocephalus.
	* Myelomeningocele  
	May lead to:
		* Hypovolaemia  
		Losses from defect.
		* Infection
		* Heat loss
