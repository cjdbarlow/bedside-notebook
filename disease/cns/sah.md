#Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Haemorrhage
 
Subarachnoid haemorrhage is a neurological emergency. SAH:
* May be:
	* Aneurysmal  
	Form of haemorrhagic stroke.
		* Accounts for 3% of all strokes
	* Traumatic
	* Other  
		* AVM
		* Fistulae
		* Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.


Grading:
* Many grading scales exist:
* The WFNS scale assists prognosis and determining post-operative destination
* The Modified Fischer scale predicts vasospasm risk

|Grade|WFNS|Hunt & Hess|Modified Fisher|
|--|--|
|**1**|GCS 15|Mild headache, no or minimal nuchal rigidity|No SAH or IVH
|**2**|GCS 13-14, no motor deficit|Moderate to severe headache, nuchal rigidity, may have CN deficit|Thin SAH, no IVH|
|**3**|GCS 13-14, motor deficit|Confusion or lethargy, with or without mild focal deficit|Thin SAH, IVH present|
|**4**|GCS 7-12|Stuporous, severe focal deficit|Thick SAH, no IVH|
|**5**|GCS 3-6|Comatose, posturing or no motor response|Thick SAH, IVH present|

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Aneurysmal SAH:
* Occurs in ~9/100,000
* Has a high mortality rate
	* 15% prehospital
	* 30% 30-day
* 40% make a good recovery  
Prognostication:
	* Age
	* Conscious state
	* Blood volume
* Risk factors include:
	* HTN
	* Smoking
	* Heavy ETOH use
	* Sympathomimetic drug use
	* Age
	* Female
	* PHx SAH
	* FHx SAH
	* Polycystic kidney disease
	* Type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome


##Pathophysiology
###Aetiology
##Clinical Manifestations
Typical presentation of:
* Sudden, severe headache  
	* "Worst headache of life"
	* Different from usual headaches
* Often associated with:
	* Loss of consciousness
	* Nausea
	* Vomiting
	* Photophobia
	* Neck pain


Headache may occur without symptoms, and patients may not seek medical attention or be misdiagnosed.

Assessment:
* GCS
* Meningeal irritation
* Focal neurology
* Fundoscopy  
May identify intraocular haemorrhage, which occurs in ~40% of cases.


##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
Imaging:
* Non-contrast CT head  
Sensitivity increases from 93% to 100% over 6 hours, and falls to 60% over the next 7 days.
* CTA  
First-line vascular imaging to identify source, though may miss aneurysms ⩽4mm.
* MRI  
May be slightly superior to CT.
* DSA  
Gold-standard for vascular imaging, and facilitates treatment.
* Transcranial Doppler  
Used to monitor for vasospasm.
	* Suggested by a Lindegaard ratio >3  
	Mean velocity in the MCA/mean velocity in ipsilateral ICA.

Lumbar puncture:
* Recommended if negative or equivocal CT in the setting of high clinical suspicion
* Method:
	* Opening pressures
	* CSF collection in 4 consecutive tubes  
	RBC can be measured consecutively to exclude traumatic tap.
	* Xanthochromia  
	By visual inspection; may take 12 hours to develop.
	* Spectrophotometry  
	Superior to visual inspection.


##Management
Control and stabilise
* Secure airway if required


Avoid rebleeding:
* Aggressive BP control to **SBP <160mmHg**  
Adjust target based on premorbid baseline BP.
	* Agents should preferably be given by infusion, and include:
		* Labetalol 5-20mg/hr
	* Short-acting opioids for analgesia
		* Dexamethasone can be considered for meningeal irritation
	* Avoid hypotension
	* Maintain euvolaemia  
	Avoid hypervolaemia.
* Consider antifibrinolytics  
For up to 72 hours, prior to aneurysm repair.


Secure aneurysm:
* Transfer to high-volume aneurysm centre for securing of aneurysm  
* Clip or coil depending on location and characteristics
	* Clipping  
	Favoured for aneurysms:
		* From the MCA
		* With a wide neck:body ratio
		* With crucial arteries from aneurysm dome
		* With a large parenchymal haematoma


Neurocritical care to prevent and manage complications:
* Delayed cerebral ischaemia
	* Nimodipine 60mg Q4H PO should be administered to all SAH patients for 21 days
		* Improves outcome but does not appear to reduce radiological vasospasm  
		Neuroprotection probably by another mechanism.
	* Repeat CT should occur at 24-48 hours to identify any new infarctions  
	Those not attributable to EVD or IPH should be considered to be due to delayed cerebral ischaemia.
	* Consider regular transcranial doppler to monitor for vasospasm
	* Patients with suspected vasospasm should have induced hypertension  
	Usually results in SBP 180-200mmHg. Depending on preference for MAP or SBP targets, consider aiming:
		* MAP 20mmHg above baseline
		* SBP 20-40mmHg above baseline
	* Consider intraarterial vasodilators or angioplasty for vasospasm-related delayed cerebral ischaemia
* Seizures  
	* Consider prophylactic anticonvulsants  
	Restrict to a short course.
	* Consider continuous EEG monitoring in patients who
		* Have a poor grade of SAH
		* Fail to improve
* Temperature control  
Target normothermia, with aggressiveness based on risk of delayed cerebral ischaemia.
* Glucose control  
Careful control with strict avoidance of hypoglycaemia.
* Anaemia  
Hb level should be maintained at 80-100g/L.
* Hyponatraemia  
Treat early with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.
* DVT prophylaxis  
UFH should be considered 24 hours after securing of aneurysm. 


###Anaesthetic Considerations
###Ineffective Therapies
Prophylactic 'triple-H' therapy:
* Not recommended due to lack of efficacy
* Consists of:
	* Hypervolaemia
	* Hypertension
	* Haemodilution  
	Theorised to improve laminar flow and increase overall DO<sub>2</sub>.

##Complications
Rebleeding:
* Major life-threatening complication
	* 20-60% mortality
	* Usually occurs within 72 hours  
	Majority (50-90%) within 6 hours.


Hydrocephalus:
* Occurs in 20% of patients  
Within minutes to hours of onset.
* Symptoms include:
	* Decreased conscious state
	* Impaired upward gaze
	* Hypertension
	* Delirium
* Diagnosis on CT
* Managed with EVD


Epilepsy:
* Occurs in 2% of patients  
Correlated with severity.


Myocardial injury:
* LV dysfunction in 10-30%
* Related to catecholamine surge  
May lead to myocardial necrosis.
* Neurocardiogenic shock/Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may arise due to combination of increased preload and afterload (catecholamines), and decreased inotropy (necrosis)

Delayed cerebral ischaemia:
* Defined as **any neurological deterioration** lasting **more than one hour** and **cannot be explained** by any other condition
* Leading cause of neurological morbidity  
Via cerebral infarction.
* Mechanisms include:
	* Vasospasm
	* Microcirculatory dysfunction
	* Microthrombosis
	* Cortical spreading depolarisation
	* Neuro-inflammation
* Associated with:
	* High serum catecholamine levels
	* Elevated serum lactate
* Leads to both:
	* Neurological complications:
		* Seizures
		* Infection
		* Cerebral oedema
	* Systemic complications:
		* Infection
		* Fever
		* APO
		* Cardiac failure

##Prognosis
>Grading systems should not be used in isolation to prognosticate for individual patients
