#Heparin Induced Thrombocytopaenia (and Thrombosis)

Immune-mediated hypercoagulable state, that:
* Occurs due to formation of auto-antibody to a heparin-platelet complex
* Is classified into:
	* **Type I**  
	Transient drop in platelet count, and is not clinically significant.
		* Occurs in first 2 days
	* **Type II**  
	Clinically significant HIT that may progress to HITT. Type II is:
		* More common
		* Presents **5-14 days after** heparin **exposure**

* Leads to:
	* Thrombocytopenia  
	Usually to 30-50% of baseline.
	* Thrombosis  
	May be arterial or venous, and in both large and small vessels.

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Incidence:
* 1:5000 of hospitalised patients   


Risk factors:
* Critically ill  
0.3-09.5%.
* Cardiac surgery  
1-3%.
* UFH > LMWH
* Female


##Pathophysiology
* Platelet factor 4 protein is expressed on platelet cell surface
* This binds heparin and activates lymphocytes and antibodies
* Production of an IgG antibody to this factor results in platelet activation

###Aetiology
##Clinical Manifestations
Key factors:
* Appropriate timing
* Thrombocytopenia  
Either <150 x10<sup>9</sup>/L or decrease by >50%.
* Thrombosis



##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
Risk may be calculated using the **4 Ts score**.

Differentials include:
* Thrombotic microangiopathy
* Drug-induced thrombocytopenia
* Venous thrombosis
* Hypersensitivity reactions

##Investigations
FBE:
* Thrombocytopenia  
Usually to ~60x10<sup>9</sup>/L.


Serotonin release assay:
* Functional test evaluating immunologic response of platelets to heparin
* Donor platelets pre-treated with C-serotonin are exposed to patient serum (or plasma nad heparin)
* Serotonin release >20-50% (lab dependent) is positive

##Management
Cease heparin:
* UFH and LMWH
* Heparin flushes in arterial lines
* Heparin bonded:
	* Extracorporeal circuits
	* Lines
	* IDCs

Transition to a non-heparinoid anticoagulant:
* Direct thrombin-inhibitor
	* Bivalirudin  
	If impaired hepatic and renal function.
	* Argatroban  
	If normal hepatic function.
* Factor Xa inhibitor  
	* Fondaparinux  
	Useful for CVTI prophylaxis.
* Vitamin K antagonist  
Only when platelet count is >150 x10<sup>9</sup>/L due to risk of worsening thrombosis.
* DOAC


Platelet transfusion:
* If platelets <20 x10<sup>9</sup>/L


Consider plasmapheresis:
* If refractory to medical therapy
* If requiring heparin/protamine for CPB in patients with previous HITT

###Anaesthetic Considerations
###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
Death:
* Up to 20%

##Prognosis
Recovery:
* Platelet count improves usually within ~1/52 after cessation of heparin  
May take weeks.
* Antibody clearance takes 50-85 days
* Future heparin exposure does not guarantee recurrence, but heparin exposure should be minimised in future
