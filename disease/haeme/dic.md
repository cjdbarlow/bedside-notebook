#Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation

Acquired syndrome characterised by extreme systemic intravascular activation of coagulation that:
* Occurs secondary to an underlying condition
* Leads to:
	* High consumption of platelets and coagulation factors  
	Leading to coagulopathy and bleeding.
	* Microvascular fibrin thrombi  
	Leading to tissue ischaemia and multiorgan dysfunction.
* May be acute or chronic
	* Acute DIC is:
		* Generally more familiar
		* Characterised by microvascular thrombosis and bleeding
	* Chronic DIC is:
		* Associated with disease where thrombin formation is occurring over a prolonged period  
		e.g. Malignancy, IUFD, aneurysms, wound healing.
		* Partially compensated  
		Upregulation of:
			* Platelet and factor production  
			Assays may be normal or only slightly abnormal.
			* Hepatic FDP clearance
		* Characterised by thrombosis without bleeding

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Conditions which lead to the development of DIC include:
* Septic shock  
Occurs in ~35% of cases of severe sepsis.
* Trauma
	* Exsanguination
	* Burns
* Obstetrics
	* Abruptio placentae 
	* Haemorrhage
	* AFE
* Vascular malformations
* Malignancy
	* Solid organ tumours  
	Primarily thrombosis.
	* Acute promyelocytic leukaemia


##Pathophysiology
Underlying disease profoundly stimulates procoagulant activity, resulting in:
* Excessive thrombin generation
* Thrombin overcomes anticoagulant control mechanisms  
Namely:
	* Protein C
	* Antithrombin
	* Tissue factor pathway inhibitor
* Thrombosis occurring throughout the vasculature

###Aetiology
##Assessment
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
DIC scoring system:
* Underlying disorder associated with DIC?  
Required.
* Coagulation results:
	* Platelet count
		* ⩾100: 0
		* 50-100: 1
		* ⩽50: 
	* FDPs
		* No increase: 0
		* Moderate increase: 2
		* Strong increase: 3
	* PT
		* ⩽	3s: 0
		* 3-6s: 1
		* >6s 2
	* Fibrinogen level:
		* ⩾1: 0
		* ⩽1: 1
* Interpretation  
Score of >5 compatible with acute DIC.




##Investigations
Laboratory investigations:
* Are not accurate to provide diagnosis on their own
* Can be used to score likelihood for DIC

Key investigations include:
* FBE
	* Anaemia  
	Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia.
	* Thrombocytopaenia  
	Low or rapidly decreasing.
* Coagulation
	* Assays (PT, APTT)  
	Prolonged, but this may be minimal.
	* Fibrinogen  
	May be either reduced or increased.
		* Reduced to consumption
		* Increased due to role as acute phase reactant
* Fibrin Degradation Products (e.g. D-dimer)  
Increased, due to fibrinolysis.

Additional investigations:
* Blood film  
	Schistocyte formation.



##Management
Treat the underlying condition.

Management then depends on predominant clinical picture:
* Active bleeding  
Transfuse to keep:
	* Platelets >30-50
	* PT <3s
	* Fibrinogen >1.5
	* Consider vitamin K
	* Consider antifibrinolytic
* No major bleeding or thrombosis  
Prophylactic LMWH.
* Overt thromboembolism or organ failure  
	* Therapeutic anticoagulation  
	Usually UFH.


###Anaesthetic Considerations
###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
Include:
* Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia
* Organ failures
	* 15% of malignancy
	* 40% of sepsis

##Prognosis
Strong independent predictor of mortality in critically ill patients.
