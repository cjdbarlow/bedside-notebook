#Anaphylaxis

*This covers both perioperative and non-perioperative anaphylaxis. Treatment recommendations for perioperative anaphylaxis are detailed separately, due to the nature of the disease (typically of more rapid onset and aggressive progression), and the immediate availability of resuscitation equipment and personnel.*

Anaphylaxis is a potentially **life-threatening emergency**. It is an IgE mediated, immediate (type I) and systemic hypersensitivity reaction, characterised by a triad of:
* Hypotension
* Bronchospasm
* Rash

##<span style="color:red">Emergency Management of Perioperative Anaphylaxis</span>
Immediate management follows a DRSABCD approach:
* Danger
	* Remove triggers  
		* Chlorhexidine  
		Including impregnated CVCs.
		* Colloid
		* Latex
* Response
	* Commence ALS if grade IV anaphylaxis
* Send for help
	* Organise team
* Airway
	* Consider **early intubation**  
	Early administration of adrenaline may avoid the need for intubation, however if airway oedema is present then early consideration of intubation is appropriate.
* Respiratory
	* Provide 100% oxygen
* Circulation
	* Gain wide-bore IV access
	* Commence rapid infusion of warm IV fluids
	* Give **adrenaline**
		* IM if no IV access or haemodynamic monitoring  
		Can consider IM dosing to provide a pseudo-infusion whilst establishing infusion.
		* Otherwise IV
		* If >3 IV boluses required, commence infusion:  
		Peripheral infusion is acceptable in the short term prior to establishing CVC access.
	* **Arterial line insertion**  
	Monitoring, titration, and blood sampling for tryptase.
	* Consider **central line insertion**  
	If ongoing vasopressor requirement.
* Disability
	* Maintain anaesthesia  
	Consider processed EEG monitoring.


Monitoring and followup:
* Grade 3 and Grade 4 anaphylaxis requires admission to ICU/HDU for monitoring and ongoing therapy as required
* Grade 1 and 2 anaphylaxis which has settled quickly should be have at least 6 hours of close monitoring


* All patients require a letter containing descriptions of the reaction and agents administered


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Triggers of non-perioperative anaphylaxis:
* Food
	* 60% of anaphylaxis in children
	* 16% of anaphylaxis in adults
* Insect venoms
	* 16% of anaphylaxis in children
	* 55% of anaphylaxis in adults
* Drugs
	* 8% of anaphylaxis in children
	* 21% of anaphylaxis in adults


###Epidemiology of Perioperative Anaphylaxis
Epidemiology:
* 56% female
* Overall less common in paediatrics
	* May be due to less use of antibiotics and muscle relaxants
	* More likely to present with bronchospasm


Causes:
* ~46% are antibiotic associated  
Teicoplanin and amoxacillin-clavulanate have the highest risk.
* ~33% are related to neuromuscular blocking drugs
	* Suxamethonium: ~11/100,000
	* Rocuronium: 6/100,000
	* Atracurium: 4/100,000
* ~10% chlorhexidine  
Typically presents more slowly, unless IV (i.e. chlorhexidine-impregnated CVC) source.
	* Increasing incidence due to increased use
	* An untested patient with a history of perioperative anaphylaxis should be managed as having chlorhexidine hypersensitivity
* Patent Blue die  
Highest risk single therapy at ~15/100,000.
	* May present with blue urticaria


##Pathophysiology
Anaphylaxis is driven by degranulation of mas cells and basophil granulocytes, causing release of:
* Histamine
* Prostaglandins
* Leukotrienes
* Tryptase
* Platelet-activating factor
* Cytokines
* Chemokines


Non-allergic anaphylaxis:
* Describes a clinical appearance of anaphylaxis where immunological sensitisation has not been detected
* Probably relates to G-protein induced release of vasoactive mediators


##Clinical Manifestations
> * Unanticipated hypotension or tachycardia should raise suspicion
> * Absence of skin signs does not rule out the diagnosis

Symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis:
* Typically occur acutely and progress rapidly
	* 83% present within 10 minutes
	* 2% present *after* 60 minutes
* Relate to involvement of different organ systems
* Relate to the region of the body affected  
Typically tissues with high concentrations of mast cells.
	* Skin  
	Skin signs are uncommon in severe anaphylaxis due to lack of perfusion.
		* Urticaria
		* Erythema
		* Angioedema
		* Airway swelling
	* Respiratory
		* Bronchospasm  
		Leading symptom in life-threatening reactions.
			* Present in 50%
			* First symptom in ~20%
		* Capnograph changes will be evident in ~30%
	* GIT
		* Nausea
		* Vomiting
		* Diarrhoea
	* CVS
		* Hypotension  
		Isolated severe hypotension was typically managed poorly in NAP6.
		* Haemoconcentration  
		Due to interstitial oedema.
			* 35-70% of circulating volume may extravasate in 10-15 minutes
		* Cardiac arrest  
		PEA most common.


Prodromal symptoms:
* Itching
* Metallic taste
* Fearfulness
* Headache
* Disorientation


###Presentation of Perioperative Anaphylaxis
* Timing
	* ~80% occurs within 10 minutes of drug administration  
	Antibiotic-associated anaphylaxis typically occurs more rapidly and aggressively.
	* ~2% occurs after 60 minutes
* Features
	* Bronchospasm
		* Occurs in 50%
		* First feature in ~20%
		* Capnograph changes in ~30%
	* Skin signs  
	Uncommon in severe reactions.


###Classification
Anaphylaxis is classified into four grades, based on severity:
* **Grade 1 (Mild)**
	* Mucocutaneous signs only
	* Does not require treatment with adrenaline
	* Does require monitoring
* **Grade 2 (Moderate)**
	* Multi-organ manifestations  
	Typically:
		* Bronchospasm
		* Hypotension  
		Perioperatively, consider **hypotension out of proportion to what would be expected** by the drugs given or the operative stage.
		* Mucocutaneous signs  
		Typically allows differentiation from isolated bronchospasm or other causes of hypotension.
* **Grade 3 (Life-threatening)**
	* Life threatening
		* Hypotension
		* Elevated airway pressures
	* Requires immediate treatment to avoid progression
	* **Cutaneous signs** frequently **absent** due to poor cardiac output state  
	May only appear following resuscitation.
* **Grade 4 (Cardiac arrest)**
	* Absence of palpable central pulse or grossly inadequate blood pressure
	* Management follows a ALS protocol  
	Consider more frequent use of adrenaline (Q1-2 minutely) and early initiation of vasopressors when initial therapy is inadequate.



##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
Differential diagnoses include:
* Respiratory
	* Status asthmaticus
	* Airway foreign body
	* Laryngotracheitis
	* Tension pneumothorax
	* Acid aspiration
	* Dislodged, kinked, or obstructed airway device
* CVS
	* Cardiogenic shock
	* Embolism
	* MI
* Endocrinological
	* Carcinoid syndrome
	* Pheochromocytoma
	* Thyrotoxic crisis
	* Hypoglycaemia
* Skin diseases
	* Urticaria
	* Hereditary/acquired angioedema
* Toxins
	* Ethanol
	* Histaminosis


##Investigations
Formal follow-up is important:
* As anaesthetists are mostly wrong about the likely causative agent
* For patients with any of the following:
	* Unexplained cardiac arrest
	* Unexplained and unexpected hypotension
	* Unexplained bronchospasm, particularly when:
		* Severe
		* Associated with desaturations
		* Treatment resistant
	* Angioedema
* To provide education for future anaesthetics
	* Notably, no cause is found in ~50% of cases


####Tryptase Testing
* Tryptase is a protease enzyme stored in granules in mast cells and basophils  
Two subtypes:
	* α-tryptase is secreted constitutively and found in health
	* β-tryptase is released by mast cells in anaphylaxis, and may be raised in cutaneous mastocytosis
* Will not be elevated in a basophil or complement-mediated anaphylaxis
* Acute elevation supports anaphylaxis diagnosis
	* Level >20μg/L is considered positive, assuming a normal baseline
	Magnitude of elevation is relevant, and is more likely to have an agent identified.
	* Peak level usually within 15-120 minutes
	* Declines over 3-6 hours
* Should be measured at the 1 (as close as possible to onset), 4, and 24 hour mark  
	* 24 hour value gives a baseline level, which can then be used to identify whether there was substantial mast cell degranulation
	* Samples require refrigeration if ⩾1 hour to laboratory


####RAST Testing
* *In vitro* testing evaluating IgE response to specific agents
	* Limited to IgE mediated reactions
* Only available for a small number of agents:
	* Suxamethonium  
	Limited sensitivity.
	* Penicillin
	* Ampicillin
	* Amoxicillin
	* Cefaclor
	* Latex
	* Chlorhexidine

####Skin Testing
* Gold standard
* Most useful for:
	* Neuromuscular blocking drugs  
	Only method to determine cross-reactivity in NMBD-induced anaphylaxis.
	* Latex
	* β-lactam antibiotics
* Requirements:
	* Must be performed **6 weeks** after the event  
	Ensure mast cell recovery has occurred.
	* Several day cessation of:
		* Antihistamines
		* Psychotropic drugs
* May involve either:
	* **Skin prick testing**  
	Agent is applied to the forearm, and then a needle prick made through the agent.
	* **Intradermal testing**  
	Injection of dilute agents *into* the dermis.*


##Management
Principles of management include:
* Human factors
	* Team leader  
	Usually most senior person present.
	* Card reader  
	Call out required actions of immediate management cards, and to communicate with the team leader.
	* Giver of adrenaline
* An ABC approach:
	* A
		* Check and secure airway
			* Prompt administration of adrenaline may avoid the need to secure the airway
			* If airway oedema is present, then consider early endotracheal intubation
	* B
	* C
		* Secure IV access
		* **IV fluid**  
			* Volume resuscitation  
			Reverses haemoconcentration due to interstitial oedema.
			* Can consider colloid, provided colloid was not given prior to onset of anaphylaxis
		* **Adrenaline**
			* Key therapy
				* Prevents further mast cell degranulation
				* Bronchodilator
				* Vasoconstrictor
			* Doses may vary depend on patient factors
				* Increased risk of CVS compromise with overdose
					* Extremes of age
					* Hypertension
					* Ischaemic heart disease
					* Hyperthyroidism
				* Catecholamine resistance
					* β-blockade
					* ACE-I use
				* Catecholamine sensitivity
					* Amphetamines
					* Cocaine
			* Intramuscular
				* Appropriate when IV access is unavailable
				* Reduces chance of severe CVS side effects
				* Provides 'depot' for continued release  
				Up to 40 minutes.
			* Intravenous
				* Appropriate in severe anaphylaxis
				* May be repeated every 1-2 minutes, as required
		* **Glucagon**  
		Recommended in patients on β-blockers.
			* 1-2mg IV Q5M
	* E
		* Position supine
		* Consider leg elevation
* Cease administration of triggers
	* Drug infusions
	* Colloids
	* Chlorhexidine  
	Remove chlorhexidine-impregnated CVC, IDC, and lubricants.
	* Latex


###Intraoperative Adrenaline Dosing  
Management reflects the nature of operative anaphylaxis, namely:
* High frequency of sudden onset, severe symptoms
* Presence of an anaesthetist

IV bolus dose adrenaline:

|Situation|Adults|Paediatrics|
|--|--|
|IM bolus (Q5M)|500μg|- 150μg in ⩽6 <br>- 300μg in 6-12
|IV bolus in Moderate/Grade II|20μg|2μg/kg
|IV bolus in life threatening/Grade III|100-200μg|4-10μg/kg
|IV bolus in cardiac Arrest/Grade IV|1mg|10μg/kg
|Starting infusion rate|3μg/min|0.1μg/kg/min
|Maximum infusion rate|40μg/min|2μg/kg/min



###Refractory Management
Anaphylaxis refractory to maximal management occurs in patients
* On β-blockers
* On ACE-Is
* With spinal blockade

For hypotension, consider:
* TOE or TTE to guide resuscitation
* ECMO/CPB to establish adequate perfusion
* Alternative vasopressors
	* Vasopressin
		* Adults: 1-2 unit bolus, then 2 units/hr
		* Paediatrics: 0.04 units/kg bolus, then 0.02-0.06 units/kg/hr
	* Noradrenaline
		* Adults: 3-40μg/min
		* Paediatrics: 0.1-0.2μg/kg/min
	* Metaraminol
	* Phenylephrine

For bronchospasm, consider:
* Excluding:
	* Pneumothorax
	* Airway device malfunction
* Bronchodilators
	* Salbutamol
		* 1200μg (12 puffs) via MDI
		* 100-200μg IV, +/- infusion at 5-25μg/min
	* Magnesium  
	2g over 20 minutes.
	* Inhalational anaesthetics
	* Ketamine


###Post-Crisis Management
Measure tryptase:
* At 0-1, 4, and 24 hours

Consider:
* Steroids  
No evidence that use of corticosteroids affects outcome.
	* May be reasonable as part of secondary management in a stable patient
	* May have a role in reducing rebound
	* Dexamethasone 0.1-0.4mg/kg, up to 12mg
	* Hydrocortisone 2-4mg/kg, up to 200mg
* Antihistamines  
	* No role in acute phase
	* May be used for symptomatic management of urticaria, angioedema, and pruritus  
	Appropriate in mild anaphylaxis.
	* No effect on hypotension and bronchospasm
	* Oral agents have a preferred side-effect profile compared to IV


###Ineffective Therapies
* Sugammadex  
Has no role in the management of rocuronium anaphylaxis.




##Complications
* Cardiac arrest  
Bradycardic/PEA arrest is most common.
* Death  
Associated with:
	* Age
	* Obesity
	* Coronary artery disease
	* β-blockade

##Prognosis
Anaphylaxis can:
* Spontaneously resolve
* Progress despite adequate therapy
