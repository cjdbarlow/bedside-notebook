# Stroke {#sec-stroke}

Sudden onset of a constellation of neurological deficits secondary to a vascular event. Stroke:

:::column-margin
Haemorrhagic stroke is covered under @sec-ich.
:::

* Symptoms are:
	* **Focal** (usually)
	* **Negative**\
	i.e. Loss of usual function, rather than the presence of a new dysfunction.
	* **Maximal** at **onset**
	* Without precipitating event
* Subdivided by cause into:
	* **Ischaemic** (85%)\
	Related to:
		* Thrombosis
		* Embolism
		* Hypoperfusion
	* **Haemorrhagic** (15%)\
		* Intracerebral
		* Subarachnoid

:::column-margin
Stroke is distinguished from TIA by resolution and radiological findings. A TIA is a clinical syndrome with:

* Abrupt onset of focal neurological symptoms consistent with ischaemia
* No radiological abnormality
* Resolution over 24 hours
:::


## Epidemiology and Risk

Epidemiology:

:::column-margin
![](/resources/stroke-death.png)

Stroke death in Australia in >55's, stratified by sex.
:::

* Second most common global cause of death\
Greatly reduced, due to control of hypertension in the community.
* Third most common cause of disability

Risk factors:

* Age\
Risk doubles every decade after 55.
* Smoking
* Cardiovascular disease
	* AF
	* HTN
	* Dyslipidaemia
	* DM
	* Previous stroke or TIA
	* IE
* Hypercoagulable state
	* Pregnancy
	* Factor V Leiden
	* Protein C/S deficiency
	* Antithrombin III deficiency
* Hyperviscosity syndromes
	* Myeloma

## Pathophysiology

All strokes result in interruption of cerebral blood flow, leading to cellular failure:

* Disruption to receptor and channel function
* Free radial release
* Mitochondrial dysfunction
* Membrane disruption
* Cell death


An ischaemic stroke has a:

* **Core infarct**\
Irretrievably damaged centre of brain, seen as cytotoxic oedema on CT. A large (>50mL) core suggests less recoverable tissue by endovascular therapy.
* **Ischaemic penumbra**\
*Potentially viable* region of brain around the ischaemic core, that is malperfused and dysfunctional but may be recoverable with restoration of blood flow.
	* A large pnenumbra may show better response to endovascular therapy
	* Slow progression of ischaemic penumbra (to core infarction) may indicate better *late* response to endovascular therapy


### Aetiology

Ischaemic:

## Clinical Manifestations

:::caution
Stroke severity is semi-objectively described using the [NIHSS](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/715/nih-stroke-scale-score-nihs). However, **endovascularly correctable** stroke may have a **low NIHSS** score. NIHSS is **not** a guide for identifying patients for reperfusion therapies.

:::column-margin
The anterior cerebral circulation refers to blood supply derived primarily from the internal carotid arteries and generally supplies the supratentorial brain excluding the occipital lobes.\
\
The posterior circulation arises from the vertebrobasilar system, and supplies the occipital lobes, cerebellum, and brainstem.\
\
A degree of overlap may occur through the posterior communicating artery in the circle of Willis.\

### Brainstem Stroke Syndromes

Identification of brainstem stroke syndromes can be (somewhat) simplified with application of three broad principles:

1. **Neural pathways run vertically**, either medially or laterally, through the entire length of the brainstem
2. Cranial nerves arise from different structures within the brainstem
3. The branches of the posterior circulation that supply the brainstem are divided into:
	* Paramedian branches, which supply medial structures:
		* Basilar artery perforators
	* Circumferential branches, which supply lateral structures:
		* Anterior inferior cerebellar artery
		* Posterior inferior cerebellar artery
		* Superior cerebellar artery

The relevant principles are summarised as the **Brainstem Rule of Four**, which states that there are:

1. **Four** cranial nerves:
	* Above the pons\
	CN III-IV. As CN I and II arise above the midbrain, they will be unaffected by a brainstem lesion.
	* In the pons\
	CN V-VIII.
	* In the medulla\
	CN IX-XII.\

:::column-margin
Brainstem vascular syndromes can be **geographically localised** to the medial or lateral aspect of a specific structure **by identifying both** the **affected pathway** and **cranial nerves**.
:::

2. **Four midline motor nuclei**, and they are all\* **factors of 12**\

:::column-margin
\*This refers to nerves 3, 4, 6, and 12; 1 and 2 are also factors of 12 but are not motor nerves. Motor nuclei (e.g. CN VII) that are not listed are not midline. 
:::

3. **Four** structures in the **midline**\
These begin with "**m**":
	* **Motor pathway** (Corticospinal tract)\
	Contralateral arm and leg.
	* Motor nuclei\
	Nuclei of the midline **motor cranial nerves**, listed in rule 2.
	* **Medial lemniscus**\
	Contralateral vibration and proprioception.
	* **Medial longitudinal fasciculus**\
	Ipsilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia.

:::column-margin
Ipsilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia is a failure of adduction of the ipsilateral eye towards the nose, with nystagmus on lateral gaze of the contralateral eye.
:::

4. **Four** structures to the **side** (lateral)\
These begin with "**s**":
	* **Spinothalamic** pathway\
	Contralateral pain and temperature.
	* **Spinocerebellar** pathway\
	Ipsilateral ataxia.
	* **Sympathetic** pathway\
	Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome.
	* Sensory nucleus of **CN V**\
	Ipsilateral facial pain and temperature.

	* ESR/CRP\
	↑ Suggests vasculitis.
	* Thrombophilia screen
	* Pregnancy


**Imaging**:

:::column-margin
CT non-con should be repeated 24 hours after perfusion therapy to evaluate for complications.
:::

* CT **non-contrast**\
	* **Grey-white differentiation** (<1 hour)\
	Occurs early  and suggests **irreversibly infarcted** brain tissue.
	* **Vasogenic oedema** (3-6 hours)\
	Hypodensity developing due to irreversible infarction.
	* **ICH**\
	Rapidly changes management plan.
	* **Hyperdense vessel**\
	Thrombus may be visible in an intracranial vessel (particularly MCA), indicating large vessel occlusion.
* **CT angiography**
	* **Occlusion**\
	Identification of large vessel occlusion to guide endovascular therapy.
	* Dissection
	* Athersclerosis
* **CT perfusion**
	* Penumbra identification\
	Identifies volume of ischaemic penumbra for supratentorial stroke.
* MRI
	* Identification of stroke\
	Particularly for the posterior fossa, which is more poorly imaged on CT.
	* Identification of ICH
	* DWI and FLAIR mismatch\
	Identifies penumbra.
* Echocardiography\
PFO, endocarditis.

:::column-margin
Echocardiography is more useful in younger patients, who are less likely to have "classical" embolic causes.

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Diagnosis relies on identifying both:

* A stroke syndrome
* The corresponding radiological deficit


Differential diagnoses include:

* Migraine\
Positive migraine symptoms (visual symptoms, paraesthesias) are less consistent with ischaemic stroke.
* Post-ictal deficit\
Should improve over minutes-hours.
* Mass lesion (e.g. Tumour, abscess)\
More gradual onset.
* PRES
* Intoxication

## Management

:::priority
* Activate a **Stroke Code**\
Rapid activation of neurology, radiology, and interventional radiology dramatically streamlines care for these patients.
Establish:
	* Weight\
	To allow TPA to be dispensed.
	* Time **Last Seen Well**\
	To establish onset, and eligibility for reperfusion.
	* Anticoagulation status
* **Expedite reperfusion**
* Optimise **physiology**
:::

**Resuscitation**:

* A
	* Airway protection\
		* Indications vary, but in RCTs have included:
			* GCS <8
			* Other aspiration risk
			* Respiratory failure (PCO~2~ > 48mmHg, PO~2~ < 60mmHg)
		* Removes the mortality and morbidity benefits of stroke unit admission
		* Is a very bad prognostic sign
* B
	* Normoxaemia\
	Investigate for a secondary cause (e.g., aspiration).
	* Normocapnoea\
	Hyperventilation may be required for high ICP.
* C
	* Blood pressure monitoring and control\
	Invasive if haemodynamically unstable or mechanically ventilated.
* D
	* EVD\
	May be required if obstructive hydrocephalus develops.
	* ICP control
		* Hyperventilation
		* Osmotic therapy
* E
	* Maintain normothermia\
	Treat temperature >38°C.


**Supportive Care**:

* A
	* Tracheostomy


**Disposition**:

* Mortality and morbidity are improved with specialist stroke unit admission\
Avoid ICU admission if possible.

### Ischaemic Stroke

:::info
These management aims are in addition to the above.
:::

**Resuscitation**:

* C
	* **Hypertension**\
	Aims (SBP/DBP):
		* Before thrombolysis: <185/<110
		* After thrombolysis: <180/105
		* No thrombolysis: <220/<120 or end-organ damage\
		↓ Cautiously (aim <15% reduction/24 hours) if not urgently required - ↑ morbidity with rapid ↓.
		* Agents
			* Labetalol 10-20mg IV
	* Hypotension\
	Much less common.
		* Aim SBP >90mmHg
		* Treat cause, and otherwise use noradrenaline

**Specific therapy**:

* **Reperfusion**\
	* Intravenous thrombolysis
 	* Intraarterial thrombolysis\
 	↑ Recanalisation rates but ↑↑ ICH.
 	* Thrombectomy
 * Pharmacological
	* **Aspirin**\
	Load (300mg) within **48** hours, but delay:
		* **24** hours following **thrombolysis**
		* Indefinitely if craniectomy planned
		* Clopidogrel should be used if aspirin is contraindicated
	* Anticoagulation\
	If required for another indication (e.g. AF), commence >4-14/7 after the stroke, depending on risk of haemorrhagic transformation. Delay is unlikely to be harmful given the repeat stroke risk (from AF) is probably low over this period.
	* Statin\
	High dose (e.g. atorvastatin 80mg).
* Procedural
	* Craniectomy\
	Two scenarios where this may be considered:
		* MMCAS with mass effect\
		↑ Survival with survivors having moderate-severe disability.
		* Cerebellar infarction with posterior fossa syndrome\
		Much better outcomes than for MMCAS.
	* EVD\
	Indicated for secondary hydrocephalus.


### Reperfusion

:::caution
Thrombolysis (if indicated) should be given as soon as possible after ICH is excluded and hypertension is controlled.

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* B
	* Hyperventilation
* D
	* ICP monitoring
	* Seizure prophylaxis
* H
	* Heparin infusion


## Anaesthetic Considerations

:::info
GA and sedation have been compared with no clear evidence of superiority
:::

:::column-margin
My approach is tailored to the individual patient, with a strong preference towards whatever will allow the proceduralist to **expedite reperfusion**.
:::

* A
	* Extubation\
	Should be extubated as soon as feasible.
* C
	* Arrhythmia\
	Correct electrolytes.
	* Blood pressure control
		* Prior to revascularisation: SBP <185 and MAP >10-20% of baseline
		* After revascularisat ion: SBP <160
* D
	* CVA
	* ICP management
* H
	* Bleeding\
	If thrombolysed prior.
* Other
	* Off the floor


## Complications

* Death\
30% 1-month mortality.
* A
	* Aspiration\
	Dysphagia common both with brainstem and hemispheric stroke.
* B
	* Pneumonia\
	Including VAP, if intubated.
	* PE\
	Accounts for **10%** of deaths following stroke.
* C
	* Dysrhythmia (40%)\
	Common.
* D
	* Malignant Infarction of the Middle Cerebral Artery (**MMCAS**)\
	* **Haemorrhagic transformation** (5%)\
	Bleeding into a previously ischaemic stroke.
		* Risks
			* Large infarct
			* Coagulopathy
			* Vascular risk factors
			* Hypertension
		* Management
			* Stop any residual thrombolysis
			* Repeat imaging
			* Correct coagulopathy
				* Cryoprecipitate 10U
				* TXA 1g
			* Neurosurgical evacuation may be indicated if mass effect
	* **Cerebral oedema** and ↑ ICP
	* **Hydrocephalus**
		* **Obstructive**\
		May be both more common and more severe following cerebellar than cortical infarction.
		* Ex-vacuo\
		Loss of brain tissue resulting in ↑ CSF volume.
	* **Seizure** (<10%)\
	Uncommon. Risk ↑ with stroke severity, and may indicated haemorrhagic transformation.
	* Hyperglycaemia (40%)
		* Common
		* Associated with mortality and morbidity
		* Tight control harmful
* E
	* Fever (50%)
* H
	* DVT\
	Early mobilisation. Prophylactic heparin should be started **>24 hours** following reperfusion.
	* Anaemia\
	Transfusion threshold not established.

:::column-margin
Things to consider if the stroke patient deteriorates:

* Haemorrhagic transformation
* Reinfarction/reocclusion
* ↑ ICP
* Seizure
* Hypoglycaemia
:::

### Malignant Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction Syndrome

A massive swelling of the MCA territory secondary to a proximal occlusion, leading to significant mass effect on the contralateral side. MMCAS:

:::column-margin
![](/resources/mmca-crani.png)

Outcomes at 12 months for patients randomised to decompressive craniectomy or non-surgical treatment for MMCAS ([Vahedi et al, 2007](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(07)70036-4/fulltext)).
:::

* Defined by >50% of MCA stroke affected on CT
* Occurs in 1-10% of patients with MCA CVA
* Has a mortality of 80%
* **Decompressive craniectomy**\
Controversial; but appropriate with:
	* Early (<48 hours) intervention
	* Young (<60) patient
	* Multidisciplinary decision
	* Shared decision making with family, noting:
		* Significantly ↑ survival
		* Significantly ↑ survival with disability
			* Majority of new survivors are at least moderately-severely disabled
			* Many new survivors will be slight-moderate disability


## Prognosis

Outcome is highly dependent on the particulars of the individual neurology. With this in mind, poor prognostic factors include:

:::column-margin
Degree of disability following stroke is commonly quantified using the **Modified Rankin Scale** (mRS):

* 0: Asymptomatic.
* 1: No significant disability. Some symptoms, but IADLs.
* 2: Slight disability. Unable to to carry out all previous activities, but IADLs.
* 3: Moderate disability. Requires some help, able to walk unassisted.
* 4: Moderately severe disability. Assistance with PADLs and walking.
* 5: Severe disability. Constant nursing care, bedridden, incontinent.
* 6: Dead
:::

* Age\
>85 has 35% in-hospital mortality.
* Requiring mechanical ventilation\
~50% in-hospital mortality (lowest for ischaemic stroke) and significantly ↑ disability in survivors.
