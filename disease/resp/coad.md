#Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

COPD is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms with incompletely reversible airflow limitation. COPD:
* Affects airways, lung parenchyma, and vasculature
* Impairs expiration via:
	* Poorly reversible airway narrowing
	* Airway smooth muscle remodelling
	* Increasing mucous production
* Includes bullous disease


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Environmental exposures:
* **Smoking**
	* **Cigarettes**
	* Pipes/cigars
	* Water pipe
	* Marijuana
* Occupational exposures
	* Dusts
	* Chemical agents
	* Fumes
* Indoor air pollution
	* Cooking fuels
* Outdoor air pollution  
Relatively small effect.

Genetic factors:
* FAM13A associated with development

##Pathophysiology
Expiratory airflow limitation via:
* Obstructive bronchiolitis  
Small airway inflammation leads to gas trapping and dynamic hyperinflation.
* Parenchymal destruction  
Leading to emphysema, which reduces:
	* Pulmonary capillary bed volume
	* Lung surface area for gas exchange
	* V/Q matching

###Aetiology
##Assessment
Key symptoms are:
* Chronic cough or sputum production
* History of exposures
* Dyspnoea  
Graded using the mMRC scale.

###Modified Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale

|MRC Grade|Breathlessness|
|--|--|
|**Grade 0**|Only with strenuous exercise|
|**Grade 1**|When hurrying or a slight incline|
|**Grade 2**|Slower than people of same age, or stopping due to shortness of breath on flat ground|
|**Grade 3**|After ~100m or a few minutes on flat ground|
|**Grade 4**|I am too breathless to leave the house, or get breathless when dressing/undressing|


###GOLD Criteria
Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease Criteria:
* Used clinically to determine severity of disease in order to prognosticate and guide therapeutic interventions
* Not appropriate for diagnosis
* Are based upon:
	* Symptom burden  
	mMRC score.
	* Number of exacerbations and hospital admissions
	* FEV<sub>1</sub>


Treatment recommendations:
* GOLD A  
Bronchodilator (LABA or SABA) offered, and continued if effective.
* GOLD B  
LABA or long-acting methacholine antagonist should be offered as initial therapy.
* GOLD C  
LAMA as initial therapy, and benefit may be seen with LAMA & LABA & inhaled corticosteroids.
* GOLD D  
LAMA & LABA as initial therapy, with inhaled corticosteroids for patients with frequent exacerbations.


##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
Diagnosis should be considered in:
* Smokers
* Age >35
* Exertional breathlessness
* Chronic cough
* Frequent winter bronchitis or wheeze

##Investigations
Respiratory function tests are diagnostic and used to grade severity:
* **FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC of ⩽0.7**
	* Reversibility is not required  
	Differentiated from asthma on clinical grounds.
* Severity graded by FEV<sub>1</sub>  
Multiple grading systems, the GOLD 2008/NICE 2010 system:
	* FEV<sub>1</sub> ⩾80% predicted  
	Mild.
	* FEV<sub>1</sub> 50-79% predicted  
	Moderate.
	* FEV<sub>1</sub> 30-49% predicted  
	Severe.
	* FEV<sub>1</sub> ⩽30% predicted  
	Very severe.

α-1 antitrypsin:
* All patients should be screened once for α1 antitrypsin deficiency  
⩽20% is suggestive of homozygous deficiency.

##Management
Medical Management:
* Smoking cessation  
Vital, and will slow down deterioration and disability before death occurs.
* Inhaled therapies  
Mainstay of day-to-day treatment. Includes:
	* Short-acting bronchodilators  
	For breathlessness and exercise limitation.
	* Long-acting bronchodilators  
	For persistent breathlessness.
* Oral therapy  
Oral corticosteroids may be required in advanced disease.
* Vaccination  
Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines decrease LRTI rate.
* NIV  
Preferred over invasive ventilation, and indicated when:
	* Respiratory acidosis
	* Severe dyspnoea with signs of fatigue
	* Persistent hypoxaemia despite supplemental oxygen
* Home oxygen  
Indicated in patients with severe resting hypoxia (PaO<sub>2</sub> <60mmHg, or ⩽55mmHg with cor pulmonale or pulmonary hypertension).


Surgical Management:
* Lung volume reduction surgery  
Improves survival in severe upper-lobe emphysema and low post-rehabilitation exercise capacity.
* Bullectomy  
Improves dyspnoea, lung function, and exercise tolerance is selected patients.
* Transplantation  
Improves quality of life in selected patients with very severe COAD.
* Bronchoscopic interventions  
Includes coils and endobronchial valves, and improves exercise tolerance and lung function at 6-12 months following treatment.


###Anaesthetic Considerations
* B
	* Smoking cessation  
	Patients are more receptive to smoking cessation perioperatively, and this should be encouraged.
	* Disease severity
		* Exercise tolerance
		* Number of exacerbations
		* Most recent course of antibiotics or steroids
		* Previous requirement for NIV or intubation
	* Wheezing  
	If present needs aggressive treatment with bronchodilators +/- steroids.
	* Active respiratory infection  
	Consider treatment and postponing surgery.
	* Consider CXR if:
		* Current infection
		* Recent deterioration in symptoms
	* Ventilator settings  
	Aim to minimise gas trapping:
		* Increase the I:E ratio to prolong expiratory time  
		Suggest 1:3-1:5.
			* May require increased inspiratory flow rate and higher Pip
		* Consider PEEP  
		Aim to splint open small airways, and if ePEEP < iPEEP then worsening of CV effects will not occur.
		* Bronchospasm

* C
	* Pulmonary hypertension
	* Concomitant IHD
* D
	* General anaesthesia  
	Increased risk, particularly with intubation and IPPV, of:
		* Laryngospasm
		* Bronchospasm
		* Barotrauma
		* Hypoxaemia
		* Cardiovascular instability
	* Regional anaesthesia
* E
	* Neuromuscular blockade  
		* Ensure complete reversal prior to extubation
		* Consider extubation directly onto NIV  
		Reduces need for post-operative reintubation.

###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
##Prognosis
Lung cancer is frequently seen and is the major cause of death.
