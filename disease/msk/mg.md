#Myasthenia Gravis

Autoimmune disease of post-synaptic ACh receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to **fatiguable weakness** of skeletal muscles. Classified by the **Osserman Classification**:
* Class I  
Ocular myasthenia.
* Class IIa  
Mild generalized myasthenia with slow progression.
	* No crises
	* Treatment responsive
* Class IIb  
Moderately severe generalized myasthenia:
	* Severe skeletal & bulbar involvement
	* No crises
	* Less than satisfactory treatment response
* Class III  
Acute fulminating myasthenia:
	* Rapid progression
	* Severe symptoms
	* Respiratory crises
	* Poor response to treatment
* Class IV  
Late severe myasthenia
	* Identical to class III, however progresses over >2 years


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
##Pathophysiology
###Aetiology
##Clinical Manifestations
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
Include:
* Symptomatic treatment
	* Anticholinesterases
		* Pyridostigmine
			* Onset within 15-30 minutes, with duration of 3-4 hours
			* Usually commenced at 30mg PO, and then titrated to effect  
			May be given IV, with 1mg IV ≃ 30mg PO.
* Chronic immunomodulation
	* Steroids
	* Other immunosuppressants
* Acute immunomodulation
	* Plasmapheresis
	* IVIg

###Medical
###Surgical
###Anaesthetic Considerations
>* Disease stability
	* Elective surgery should occur when a patient requires minimal immunomodulation or glucocorticoids
	* Surgery should occur in the morning  
	Usually greatest muscular strength.
> * Anticholinesterases should be continued
> * **Stress dose steroids** may be required

* A
	* Bulbar symptoms  
	Indicate risk of aspiration.
* B
	* Respiratory muscle function  
	Consider PFTs to predict need for ICU admission.
* D
	* Conduct of anaesthesia  
	Use **short-acting agents** to minimise respiratory depression and time taken for emergence.
* E
	* Muscle relaxants  
	Avoid wherever possible.
		* Highly sensitive to non-depolarising agents
		* Avoid reversal with neostigmine where possible  
		May precipitate cholinergic crisis.
		* Resistant to suxamethonium

###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
Myasthenic crisis:
* Sudden weakness of respiratory or bulbar muscles, which may require intubation
* May be precipitated by physiological stress, including:
	* Infection
	* Medication adjustment
	* Surgery
* May require neurophysiological studies to differentiate it from cholinergic crisis
* Requires neurologist involvement, and usually:
	* ICU
	* Plasmapheresis
	* IVIG

Cholinergic crisis:
* Excess ACh due to excessive cholinesterase inhibition
* Presents as weakness and signs of parasympathetic stimulation from excess ACh, i.e.
	* Salivation
	* Lacrimation
	* Urination
	* Defecation
	* Emesis
