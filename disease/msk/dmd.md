#Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

Most common muscular dystrophy of childhood.

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
DMD:
* X-linked recessive disorder
* Incidence of 1:3,500 live births

##Pathophysiology
Genetic absence of the gene coding for the dystrophin protein, which:
* Prevents dystrophin expression in muscle sarcolemma  
Subsequent weakness.
* Muscle fibres are poorly tethered due to sarcolemma weakness
* Muscle fibres are gradually replaced with fibrous connective tissue

###Aetiology
##Assessment
Generally:
* Presents in early childhood
* Progressive proximal muscle wasting
* Waddling gait
* Pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles

##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
###Anaesthetic Considerations
###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
Include:
* Contractures
* Scoliosis
	* Restrictive lung disease
* Cardiomyopathies  
DCM in 50% of children by age 12.

##Prognosis
Usually fatal in late adolescence due to:
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac failure
