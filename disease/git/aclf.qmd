# Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure

Acute **decompensation of stable** compensated or uncompensated **chronic liver disease** leading to additional organ failure and â†‘ short term mortality. ACLF is:

* Reversible with treatment
* Associated with higher short-term mortality compared to decompensation of cirrhosis
* Characterised by:
	* Ascites
	* Encephalopathy
	* Gastrointestinal haemorrhage\
	Up to 20% 6-week mortality.
	* Infection
* Classified using the ACLF grade by number of extrahepatic organ failures into:
	* **Class 1**\
	One extrahepatic organ failure., further divided into:
		* 1a: Renal failure
		* 1b: Non-kidney organ failure
	* **Class 2**\
	Two extrahepatic organ failures.
	* **Class 3**\
	Three extrahepatic organ failures.

| **1** | 14%              | 20%                              |

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Common precipitants include:

* Infection
	* Bacterial peritonitis
* Variceal haemorrhage
* Alcoholic hepatitis\
Acute onset of jaundice or ascites in a patient with chronic alcohol abuse.
* HCC
* Portal vein thrombosis


## Clinical Features

Usual presentations include:

:::column-margin
Hepatic encephalopathy is covered under @sec-hep_enc.
:::

* Encephalopathy
* Sepsis
* Renal failure
* Variceal haemorrhage


## Investigations

**Imaging**:

* Ultrasound
	* Portal vein patency
	* Hepatic vein patency
	* Malignancy


**Other**:

* Ascitic tap


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx



## Management

:::priority
* Treat concurrent hepatic encephalopathy\
Preventative measurement with lactulose and rifaximin may also apply.
:::

**Resuscitation**:

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
* Procedural
* Physical


**Supportive care**:

* A
	* Intubation\
	For aspiration prevention with haematemesis.
* C
	* Individualise MAP target\
	Tolerate MAP 60mmHg (or lower, depending on baseline pressure).
		* Noradrenaline 1^st^ line
		* Vasopressin 2^nd^ line
* D
	* ICP control
	* Low dose sedation usually adequate
* G
	* Feeding\
	Protein 1.2-2g/kg/day.
	* Correct hypoglycaemia
	* Trace element and micronutrient supplementation
* H
	* Hb >70

:::column-margin
Cerebral oedema secondary to hyperammonaemia is less common in ACLF due to established compensatory mechanisms.
