# Acute Liver Failure {#sec-alf}

Rapidly progressive, life-threatening development of **coagulopathy** (INR >1.5), **encephalopathy**, and **jaundice** in a patient with a previously normal liver secondary to massive liver parenchymal injury.

:::column-margin
Acute Liver Failure is distinct from:

* **Acute Liver Injury**\
Coagulopathy and jaundice in absence of encephalopathy.
* **Acute on Chronic Liver Failure**\
Acute decline in liver function in patients with chronic liver disease.
:::

ALF is subclassified by time interval between jaundice and encephalopathy into:

* **Hyperacute**\
Encephalopathy within 7 days. Typically:
	* Severe encephalopathy, coagulopathy, ↑ ICP, and very deranged LFTs\
	Encephalopathy usually preceeds jaundice.
	* Common aetiologies: paracetamol, viral hepatitis
	* Higher rate of spontaneous recovery
* **Acute**\
Encephalopathy within 28 days. Typically:
	* More gradual decline
	* Common aetiologies: idiosyncratic drug reactions, viral hepatitis
* **Subacute**\
Encephalopathy within 3 months. Typically:
	* Less deranged LFTs
	* Common aetiologies are drug or immune-mediated disease and *un*likely to be pregnancy-related or viral. 
	* Poorest recovery in absence of transplantation
	* Greatest degree of jaundice

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Rare:

* 400 cases annually in the UK


## Pathophysiology

Pathological processes:

* Direct hepatocyte damage
* Immune response
	* Local
	* Systemic
		* MODS
* Cerebral dysfunction
	* Oedema
	* Altered autoregulation


### Aetiology

* **Vascular**
	* Ischaemia
	* Budd-Chiari Syndrome\
	Hepatic vein thrombosis, usually with an underlying procoagulant condition.
* **Infection**
	* Hepatitis A\
	Infection rarely leads to liver failure (<1%) and contributes to ~10% of infective cases.
	* Hepatitis B\
	25-75% of viral cases. **Reactivation** may occur in immunosuppressed patients.
	* Hepatitis C\
	Common cause of CLD but rarely causes acute failure.
	* Other viruses may cause rarely infection in the immunocompromised:
		* EBV
		* Measles
		* HSV 1/2
	* Dengue
	* Yellow fever
	* Lassa
* **Autoimmune**
* **Drugs**/toxins
	* **Paracetamol**\
	50-70% of cases in the developed world. Occurs due to:
		* Depletion of hepatic glutathione\
		Consumed in conjugating NAPQI, a Phase I metabolite of paracetamol.
		* NAPQI accumulation causes direct hepatocyte injury
	* Aspirin\
	Reye's syndrome.
	* Herbal
	* Halothane
	* Antituberculosis drugs
	* Alcohol
	* Ecstasy
	* *Amanita phalloides*\
	Mushroom poisoning. Usually presents with diarrhoea, followed by hepatic necrosis at 48-72 hours.
* Pregnancy-related\
	* Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
	* Severe pre-eclampsia
	* Liver rupture
* Hyperthermia
* Other
	* Wilson disease
	* Haemophagocytic syndrome


:::column-margin
Causes vary substantially with geography.

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

**Laboratory**:

* Blood
	* Liver function testing\
	Severity and pattern of injury:
		* Hepatocellular
		* Cholestatic
	* Point of care coagulation studies\
	*May* be more accurate than standard assays.
	* Coagulation studies
		* Synthetic function
	* Lactate\
	Failure of hepatic clearance.
	* **Ammonia**\
	Neurotoxin responsible for much of hepatic encephalopathy.
		* \>100μmol/L predicts the onset of encephalopathy
		* \>150-200μmol/L predicts risk of herniation
		* ↑ Ammonia may reflect:
			* Hepatic metabolic dysfunction\
			Degree of hepatic dysfunction typically correlates with ammonia level, though not with the degree of encephalopathy.
			* ↑↑ Protein intake
			* ↑ GI ammonia production\
			Produced by gut bacteria.
			* ↓ Clearance\
			Urea cycle disorder.
	* UEC\
		* AKI
		* Electrolyte derangements
	* FBE
		* Anaemia
		* Thrombocytopaenia
		* Concurrent infection
	* Lipase/amylase
		* Associated pancreatitis
	* Paracetamol level
	* LDH\
	Malignancy.
	* Viral screen\
	Aetiology. Include:
		* Hepatitis A
		* Hepatitis B\
		Core antigen indicates infection. Surface antigen often negative.
		* Hepatitis C\
		Positive antibodies indicate infection.
		* Hepatitis E\
		Positive antibodies indicate infection. Usually faecal-oral, though a subtype is transmissable by blood.
		* EBV
		* HSV
		* VZV
		* HIV 1/2
	* Autoimmune screen
		* ANA\
		Autoimmune.
		* Anti-smooth muscle Ab\
		Autoimmune.
		* Anti-mitochondrial Ab\
		Primary sclerosing cholangitis.
		* Copper studies\
		Wilson's disease.
	* Blood cultures
	* Pregnancy test
* Urine
	* Drug screen
		* Paracetamol

:::column-margin
Albumin is relatively unhelpful in ALF. LFTs are useful for determining cause.
\
INR is more useful than bilirubin as it has a shorter half-life and so is more useful for tracking trends.
:::

**Imaging**:

* TTE
	* RV function
	* Transplant assessment
* Liver ultrasound
	* Splenomegaly
	* Ascites
	* Nodularity
	* Hepatomegaly
	* Portal blood flow
	* Portal patency
* CT\
Triple-phase liver.


**Other**:

* Liver biopsy
	* Rare in acute setting due to coagulopathy\
	Transjugular route safest.
	* Non-specific necrosis most common finding
	* May be useful in diagnosis of:
		* Autoimmune
		* Wilson's disease

## Management

:::priority
* Prevent **cerebral oedema** and treat concurrent @sec-hep_enc
* Manage **vasodilatory shock**
* **Treat** concurrent **sepsis**\
Gram negative and fungal.
* Manage **coagulopathy**
* Early **identification** of patients for **transplant**
	* Significant improvement in outcomes with **emergency liver transplantation**
	* **Early** escalation to **critical care** and early referral to a **specialist centre** is essential
:::

**Resuscitation**:


**Specific therapy**:

* Paracetamol overdose
	* **N-acetylcysteine** (NAC)\
		* Cornerstone of therapy as early administration results in significant reduction in mortality (to <1%), though even late administration may improve outcome
		* Dosing based on Prescott nomogram
* Viral hepatitis
	* Antivirals
	* Hepatitis B
		* Lamivudine\
		Benefit if given early.
* Alcoholic hepatitis
* Autoimmune hepatitis
	* Steroids
* Mushroom poisoning
	* Forced diuresis\
	↑ Renal clearance of toxin. Avoid hypovolaemia.
* Wilson's disease
	* D-Penicillamine\
	Chelates copper. Withdrawal of chronic treatment may precipitate failure.
* Hepatic vein thrombosis
	* Thrombolysis
	* Clot retrieval
	* TIPS

:::column-margin
Management of paracetamol overdose is covered under @sec-pmolod.
:::

**Supportive care**:

:::column-margin
Invasive intracranial pressure monitoring associated with ~10% intracranial haemorrhage rate.
:::

* A\
Consider **securing airway** if:
	* High grade (III/IV) hepatic encephalopathy
	* Need for transfer
* B
	* **Lung protective ventilation**\
	ARDS risk.
	* Drain pleural effusions
* C
	* **Volume resuscitation**\
	Can be aggressive in absence of pulmonary hypertension.
	* MAP 65-70mmHg\
	Or **higher** if targeting **CPP** with concurrent hepatic encephalopathy.
		* Noradrenaline 1^st^ line
		* Vasopressin 2^nd^ line
	* **Corticosteroids** for vasopressor-refractory shock
		* Hydrocortisone 50mg IV Q6H
* E
	* ↓ **BSL**\
	Use high-concentration dextrose to avoid cerebral oedema/↓ Na^+^.
* F
	* **RRT**\
		* Use bicarbonate buffered solutions\
		Avoid citrate! 
		* CRRT strongly preferred for haemodynamic stability
		* Haemodiafiltration preferred\
		Dialysis is probably more effective than filtration, but both mechanisms are effective.
		* In addition to standard indications, initiate for:
			* Hyperammonaemia (>100μmol/L)\
				* Aim <60μmol/L once commenced
				* High doses (45-90mL/kg/hr) are often used to ↑ ammonia clearance\
				↑ Rate by 50% until target ammonia reached.
			* Hyperthermia
	* Avoid positive fluid balance
* G
	* Early low-protein **enteral feeding**
		* May have ↑ metabolic requirements\
		* Feeding may need to be interrupted if ammonia ↑ 
	* Hyperammonaemia
		* **Lactulose**\
		Controversial. May ↓ hepatic encephalopathy but lead to gaseous intestinal distension.
	* **PPI**
	* **Drain ascites**\
	For haemodynamic benefit.
	* **Extra-corporeal hepatic support**\
	 Broadly, ↓ encephalopathy and ↑ haemodynamic function without mortality benefit.
		* Should be regarded as experimental
		* Can be considered for severe refractory vasodilatory shock
		* Include:
			* Coupled Plasma Filtration Adsorption (CPDFA)
			* Molecular Adsorbant Recirculation System (MARS)
			* Single Pass Albumin Dialysis (SPAD)
		* Underlying mechanism is either:
			* Biological\
			Using human/porcine cells.
			* Mechanical\
			Molecular filtration.

**Disposition**:

* Liver transplant centre\
Referral if:
	* Hepatic encephalopathy
	* Ammonia >100μmol/L


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies


## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death
	* Intracranial hypertension\
	Most common mechanism in untreated disease.
	* Sepsis/multiorgan failure
* A
	* Unprotected airway
* B
	* ARDS\
	Relatively intolerant of permissive hypercapnoea due to ↑ ICP concerns.
	* Pleural effusions
* C
	* Distributive shock
* D
	* Intracranial hypertension\
	Usually develops rapidly with little time for adaptation.
	* Hepatic encephalopathy
* F
	* AKI (hepatorenal syndrome)\
	40-80% of cases.
		* ↑ In paracetamol toxicity (directly nephrotoxic)
* G
	* ↓ BSL
	* Pancreatitis
	* Ascites
* H
	* Coagulopathy\
	Clinical manifestations often not in consistent with assays.
	* Bone marrow suppression
		* Thrombocytopaenia
* I
	* Infection\
	↑ Susceptibility due to functional immunosuppression.


## Prognosis

Spontaneous recovery occurs in only **40%**. Factors:

* Age\
↑ Mortality with ↑ age.
* Aetiology\
↓ Mortality with pregnancy-related causes.
* Acuity\
↑ Mortality with ↑ acuity.

Transplantation:

* 80% 5-year survival following liver transplant for ALF

### Scoring {#sec-alfscoring}

The King's criteria are the most widely used scoring system to predict liver transplant. However, there are several important caveats to use of the tool:

:::column-margin
![Estimated Survival of 20-year Old Patients Meeting Transplant Criteria](/resources/kcc.png)
:::

* Development and validation occurred at a single centre in the 1970s and 1980s\
	* Medical management of hepatic failure in generation and paracetamol toxicity in particular has improved significantly in the interim
	* Patients at King's who received transplantation typically had a better prognosis than those who didn't
		* Patients meeting criteria who were not listed had a 9% survival
		* Patients meeting criteria who were listed but did not receive a transplant had 17% survival
* Moderate specificity\
~90% specific for need of transplantation; ~15% of patients meeting criteria will survive without transplantation.
* Low sensitivity\
~60%; such that 40% of patients who do not meet criteria may still die from liver failure.
* Patients who survive the acute liver injury and who do not receive a transplant are spared the cumulative mortality risk and quality of life impairments that come with having a liver transplant
* Patients without cerebral oedema or haemodynamic instability tend to survive with standard ICU care
