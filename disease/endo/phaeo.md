#Phaeochromocytoma

Catecholamine-secreting tumour of chromaffin tissue. Divided into:
* Phaeochromocytoma  
Arise from the adrenal gland.
	* 70% of cases
	* Usually unilateral
* Paraganglioma  
Arise from extra-adrenal autonomic ganglia:
	* Bladder
	* Sympathetic chain


* Usually present due to symptoms from excessive catecholamines

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Incidence is ~0.2/100,000.


Risk factors include:
* MEN II
* Neurofibromatosis
* Tuberous sclerosis
* Sturge-Weber Syndrome
* von Hippel-Lindau disease
* Succinate dehydrogenase enzyme mutations


##Pathophysiology
Tumour of chromaffin cells:
* 30% malignant
* 30% 

Produce a variety of:
* Adrenaline
* Noradrenaline  
Most common: ~60%.
* Dopamine  
Rarer.


###Aetiology
Majority are incidental, though ~30% are associated with autosomal dominant inheritance.


##Clinical Manifestations
Presentation:
* Classical triad of:  
Most patients do not have all 3.
	* Headache
	* Sweating
	* Palpitations
* Hypertension  
Present in 90%, paroxysmal in 50%.
	* Associated cardiomyoapthy
* Visual disturbance  
Hypertension-related papilloedema.
* Abdominal pain  
Secondary to ischaemia.
* Constitutional symptoms
	* Lethargy
	* Anxiety
	* Nausea
	* Weight loss
	* Hyperglycaemia
	* Tremor


###Intraoperative Diagnosis
Phaeochromocytomas may present during another surgery:
* Hypertension  
Major sign.
* Tachyarrhythmias
* Cardiac failure

##Investigations
Diagnosis:
* Metanephrines  
	* Breakdown products of catecholamines
		* Metanephrine
		* Normetanephrine
		* Homovanillic acid for dopamine
	* Can be measured in urine and plasma  
	Unsure which is superior.
		* Urinary more specific
		* Plasma more sensitive
	* Many causes of false-positives:
		* Exercise
		* Venous sampling whilst sitting
		* Diet
		* Renal impairment
		* Medications
* Imaging
	* Half of cases are diagnosed incidentally on CT or MRI
	* CT
	* MRI  
	Better sensitivity for paraganglionomas.
	

Evaluation of haemodynamic effects:
* Echocardiography  
Mandatory.
* ECG
* Cardiac enzymes
* UEC/CMP

##Management{#mx}
Surgery is curative, but never emergent.

Medical management:
* Required to optimise haemodynamic state pre-operatively  
This is **critical** to avoid excess morbidity and mortality; up to 45% without adequate control. Consequences:
	* CVA/ICH
	* Arrhythmias
	* Ischaemia
	* LVF
* Titration of agents usually over ~ 2 weeks 
* Goals of treatment:
	* **Control arterial pressure**  
	Primarily α-blockade.
		* **Must occur prior to β-blockade** to prevent unopposed α effect  
		CHF, ischaemia, shock from a low-CO high-SVR state.
		* Phenoxybenzamine  40-400mg/day  
		Non-competitive, non-selective, long acting α-antagonist.
			* Commence at 10mg BD, increase every 2-3 days
			* Reduces catecholamine surges
			* Increases postural hypotension
			* Implicated in post-operative hypotension
			* Should be **stopped 24-48 hours prior** to surgery
		* Doxazosin  
		Competitive, selective α1-antagonist.
			* Reduced postural hypotension compared to phenoxybenzamine
		* Calcium channel blockers  
		Good second agent to further improved BP control in patients with good α-blockade.
			* Not recommended as monotherapy
			* Consider nicardipine 30mg SR BD
	* **Replete circulating volume**  
	Reduced due to low circulatory compliance.
		* High sodium diet, high fluid intake
		* 2L/day minimum
		* Monitor haematocrit to ensure it is reducing
	* **Control heart rate and arrhythmias**
		* β-blockade  
		May be required to control tachyarrhythmias occurring after α-blockade achieved.
			* Selective β1 antagonists preferred  
			Metoprolol, atenolol.
			* Aim **HR ⩽90**
		* Correct electrolyte deficiencies
	* **Optimise myocardial function**  
		* Diastolic dysfunction in majority
		* Systolic dysfunction in ~10%
	* **Control BSL**
	* **Correct electrolyte deficiencies**



Adequacy of preoperative control:
* Traditionally given by the **Roizen criteria**  
Exact use is questioned, but principle remains. Criteria require 2 weeks of:
	* BP consistently <160/90  
	Tighter targets now used; aim seated SBP <130/80.
	* Postural drop of SBP >15% but not <80 mm Hg  
	No longer required.
	* ECG without ischaemia  
	Ischaemia is still to be avoided, but changes may represent Takotsubo rather than ischaemia.
	* Control of episodic symptoms
* Preoperative optimisation performed over days-weeks


###Anaesthetic Considerations
* B
	* Pulmonary oedema
* C
	* Arterial line
	* Consider CO monitoring
	* Haemodynamic control
	**Preoperative optimisation required**.
		* May be performed as an inpatient in some systems
	* Cardiomyopathy  
	Bulk of patients have EF ~55% however.
	* Impaired catecholamine sensitivity
	* Avoidance of drugs with catecholamine effects
		* Desflurane
		* Ketamine
		* Morphine/pethidine
		* Atracurium/pancuronium
		* Droperidol/metoclopramide
* D
	* Impaired insulin sensitivity  
	Hypoglycaemia may occur following resection - monitor postoperatively.
	* Anxiolysis


##Complications
Due to excessive catecholamine effects:
* Pulmonary oedema
* Cardiomyopathy
* Arrhythmia
* ICH/CVA
