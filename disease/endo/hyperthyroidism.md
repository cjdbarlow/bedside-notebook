#Hyperthyroidism

Disease of excess thyroid hormone, which leads to a constellation of symptoms. Hyperthyroidism may be classified into:
* Primary  
Excess secretion of hormone from thyroid gland, further divided into:
	* Overt  
	Elevated thyroid hormone with suppressed TSH.
	* Subclinical  
	Normal thyroid hormone levels with suppressed TSH.
* Secondary  
Excessive TSH production from pituitary gland.

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Risk factors:
* Female:Male is 2:1

##Pathophysiology
###Aetiology
Include:
* Grave's disease
* Toxic nodular goitre
* Thyroiditis
* Drug induced
	* Amiodarone

##Clinical Manifestations
###History
###Examination
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management


###Thyroid Storm

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* B
	* ↓ Apnoea time due to ↑ VO<sub>2</sub>
* C
	* ↑ HR
	* Arrhythmia
		* AF
	* CCF
	* IHD
* E
	* Heat intolerance
	* Weight loss
* E<sub>2</sub>
	* Thyroid state  
	Patients should be euthyroid preoperatively to avoid thyroid storm.
		* Carbimazole  
		Decreases iodine uptake and inhibits peroxidase enzyme, preventing iodine coupling.
		* Propothiouracil  
		Inhibits thyroperoxidase, and also decrease T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub> conversion.
		* Steroids  
		Decrease T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub> conversion.
		* Lugol's Iodine
		* β-blockers


###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
Systemic effects:
* C
	* AF  
	10-40% incidence.
	* Palpitations
	* CHF
* E
	* ↑ Incidence of myasthenia gravis
* H
	* Thyrombocytopenia
	* Anaemia

###Thyroid Storm
Exacerbation of hyperthyroidism that:
* May be life threatening
* Occurs during periods of stress
* May occur up to 18 hours post-operatively
* Manifests with:
	* Tachycardia
	* Tachyarrhythmia
	* ↑ Pulse pressure
	* Cardiac failure/cardiovascular collapse
	* Altered mental state  
	Anxiety, psychosis, coma.
	* Profound hyperthermia  
	⩾40°C.
	* Myopathy  
	Rhabdomyolysis occurs in ~50%.
* Requires aggressive treatment with:
	* Supportive therapy
		* Oxygen supplementation
		* Fluid resuscitation
		* Diuresis  
		If rhabdomyolysis present.
		* Temperature correction
	* Curative therapy
		* Propylthiouracil 200-250mg PO Q4H  
		Prevents thyroid hormone synthesis.
		* Sodium iodide 1-2.5G IV  
		Prevents thyroid hormone release. Needs to be given at least **one hour after** propylthiouracil to prevent subsequent iodine escape.
		* Hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8H  
		Reduces T4-T3 conversion.
		* β-blockade  
		Caution if cardiac failure.
			* Propranolol 
			In addition to β effects, also reduces T3 levels.
				* 20-120mg PO  
				* 0.5-1mg IV over 10 minutes, then 1-2mg over 10 minutes Q4H  
				Requires haemodynamic monitoring.
			* Esmolol 50-300μg/kg/min
