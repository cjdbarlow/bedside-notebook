#Laryngospasm

> This is an <span style="color:red">**anaesthetic crisis**</span>  
> Priority is to:
>* **Break laryngospasm**
>* **Maintain oxygenation**

Involuntary contraction of the laryngeal muscles, resulting in closing of the vocal cords and glottic occlusion.


##<span style="color:red">Emergency Management</span>
Immediately:
* Cease painful stimulation
* Prepare for intubation  
Delegate person to assemble drugs and airway equipment.

* Provide 100% oxygen
* Remove airway devices 
In mild laryngospasm (without total obstruction) it may be reasonable to attempt to break laryngospasm with the LMA in situ.
* Provide CPAP 30cmH<sub>2</sub>O  
This aims to stent open the airway.
	* Typically via face mask  
	Ensure optimal position, consider use of airway adjuncts.
	* Deliver low tidal volume ventilation if able via short, sharp squeezes on the bag  
	**Forced inflation will worsen obstruction if there is complete glottic occlusion**.
* Suction airway
* Consider applying painful pressure bilaterally on Larson's point, which *may* break laryngospasm  
Between mastoid process and posterior edge of mandible, applying pressure anteriorly and medially.

* If SpO<sub>2</sub> >92%, or if desaturation is expected to occur rapidly (obese, children)  
Deepen anaesthesia or relax the patient:
	* Suxamethonium 0.5mg/kg
	* Propofol ~20% of induction dose  
	Effective in ~80% of cases.
		* Deepens anaesthesia
		* Suppresses reflexes
	* Overpressure sevoflurane  
	If airway patent enough to ventilate.


* If SpO<sub>2</sub> <92%  
Procede directly to intubation:
	* Suxamethonium 1-2mg/kg  
	IM is appropriate if an IV route is not available.

###Controversial Treatments
Lignocaine has been described to reduce coughing and laryngospasm:
* Evidence is not conclusive
* May decrease incidence of laryngospasm in at-risk groups
* Not included in many emergency algorithims as its use may delay definitive therapy

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Laryngospasm is common (~9 per 1000 anaesthetics) and is associated with:
* Light anesthesia  
On induction and emergence.
* **Children**  
Double risk relative to adults (~18/1000 cases), greatest in preschool age groups.
* Airway contamination and stimulation:
	* ENT surgery  
	~20/1000 cases.
	* Oral secretions  
	Worse with recent URTI.
	* Blood
	* Foreign body
	* Aspiration/regurgitaiton/reflux
	* Near drowning


##Pathophysiology
Airway protection is a function of the larynx. The protective nature of the larygneal closure reflex is exaggerated and prolonged in laryngospasm.

Mechanics of laryngospasm can be divided into:
* Inspiratory stridor  
Occurs passively due to reduced aductor muscle tone.
* Expiratory stridor  
Due to active adduction of the cords.
* Ball-Valve obstruction  
Due to closure of the true cords, the false cords, and the supraglottic tissues.
	* In this mechanism, **positive pressure may worsen obstruction** as distension of the pyriform fossae press the aryepiglottic folds more firmly against each other
	* Jaw thrust is more effective in correcting obstruction via this mechanism (though paralysis is still often required)


##Clinical Manifestations
Laryngospasm should be suspected whenever there is airway obstruction with potential supraglottic cause.

Laryngospasm presents with:
* Stridor  
If airway is not completely occluded.
* Respiratory distress
	* Tachypnoea
	* Chest retraction  
	Due to very negative inspiratory airway pressures.
* Hypoxia  
May occur due to:
	* Impaired ventilation
	* Negative pressure pulmonary oedema
* Bradycardia and arrrest  
Secondary to hypoxia.


###History
###Examination
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
###Preventative Management
###Post-Emergency Management
Once laryngospasm is broken:
* Consider deflating the stomach with an OGT prior to extubation
* Ensure deep anaesthesia for duration of muscle relaxation
* Ensure extubation only when the patient is fully awake  
Prior to extubation, perform an **artificial cough**:
	* Single lung inflation with 100% O<sub>2</sub> prior to extubation
		* Delays desaturation
		* Ensures positive pressure in the trachea, which should result in forceful expiration clearing debris from laryngeal inlet

##Complications and Prognosis
Laryngospasm will break with **severe hypoxia**, but this may only occur after:
* Bradycardia and arrest, and death
* Aspiration
* Pulmonary oedema  
Negative pressure pulmonary oedema secondary to inspiratory efforts against a closed glottis.
