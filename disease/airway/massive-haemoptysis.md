#Massive Haemoptysis

> This is an <span style="color:red">**anaesthetic crisis**</span>  
> Priority is to:
>* **Decontaminate the airway**
>* **Maintain oxygenation**

Large haemorrhage into the pulmonary tree which:
* Is variably defined as 100-1000mL of haemoptysis/day
* May precipitate cardiac arrest secondary to **hypoxia**

##<span style="color:red">Emergency Management</span>
Immediately:
* **Protect airway**
	* Large, **single-lumen** ETT
		* Suction catheter/bronchoscopic decontamination
	* Consider lung isolation
		* Bronchial blocker  
			* May be passed outside the ETT and placed under bronchoscopic guidance
			* Consider use of a 14Fr Fogarty catheter
		* Endobronchial tube
* Haemodynamic resuscitation  
	* Cardiac arrest is common
	* Hypoxia is almost always the cause
	* Hypovolaemia is rarely significant

Definitive treatment:
* Source control  
Options include:
	* Rigid bronchoscopy
	* Interventional angiography  
	Bronchial angiography and embolisation.  
		* Note risk of paralysis due to loss of spinal perfusion
	* Thoracotomy
* Correction of coagulopathy




##Epidemiology and Risk Factors

##Pathophysiology
* 90% of haemorrhage comes from the bronchial circulation  
These bleeds are dependent on ***systemic* blood pressure**.

###Aetiology
Causes can be divided into:
* Airway
* Trauma
	* Suction
	* Foreign body
	* Tracheo-arterial fistula
	* Blunt/penetrating
* Primary lung disease
	* **Infective**
		* Mycobacterial
		* Fungal
		* Lung abscess
		* Parasitic
			* Hydatid cyst
			* Paragonimiasis
		* Necrotising pneumonia  
		*Staphylococcus*, *Klebsiella*, *Legionella*.
	* **Neoplasm**
		* Primary
		* Metastases
		* Sarcoma
* Cardiac
	* LV failure
	* Mitral stenosis
* Vascular
	* Vasculitis
		* Wegener's granulomatosis
		* Behcet's disease 
	* Vascular
		* AVM
		* PE
* Coagulopathy
	* von Willebrand's Disease
	* Haemophilias
	* Anticoagulants
	* Thrombocytopenia
* Iatrogenic
	* PAC
	* Bronchoscopy
	* Biopsy
	* Transtracheal aspiration

##Clinical Manifestations
###History
###Examination
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
Medical:
* If related to PAC:  
Withdraw catheter slightly and reinflate to provide proximal compression, prior to surgical resection.

Interventional:
* Bronchial artery embolisation
	* Used for life-threatening haemoptysis
	* Failure in up to 10%
* Surgical resection  
Treatment of choice when site is localised and patient can tolerate resection.
