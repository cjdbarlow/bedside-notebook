#Hypertensive Dieases of Pregnancy

Hypertension in pregnancy is:
* Common
* Associated with increased maternal, foetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality
* Associated with additional complications
* Classified into four sub-groups:
	* **Gestational hypertension**
		* SBP > 140mmHg *or* DBP > 90mmHg
		* Present after 20<sup>th</sup> week of gestation
		* Resolving following delivery  
	Usually within 6 weeks.
	* **Preeclampsia/Eclampsia**
		* Preeclampsia is defined as **gestational hypertension** with **organ system involvement**  
		Preeclampsia with severe features is preeclampsia with severe end-organ dysfunction or hypertension  
		Covered further under [clinical features](#clinical).
		* Eclampsia is defined as **preeclampsia** with **seizures**
	* **Chronic hypertension**  
	Pre-existing hypertension.
	* **Chronic hypertension with super-imposed preclampsia/eclampsia**


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Risk factors include:
* Patient factors:
	* Age > 35
	* Pre-existing HTN
	* CKD
	* DM
	* Anaemia
	* Living at altitude
	* *Non-*smokers
* Pregnancy factors:
	* Nulliparity
	* Multiple gestation

Preecampsia is:
* A leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality
* Present in 5-8% of pregnancies

Eclampsia:
* Occurs in ~0.05% of pregnancies
* Risk continues up to 1 week following delivery  
30% of seizures are post-partum.


##Pathophysiology
Underlying processes driving placental insufficiency include:
* Maternal endothelial dysfunction
	* Altered endothelial function
		* Increased endothelil secretion
		* Decreased nitric oxide
	* Normal development of a high-flow, low-resistance placental circulation does not occur
* Acute atherlosclerosis and thrombosis of placental vessels  
Results in decreased placental flow and structural blood vessel damage.

These processes:
* Lead to the triad of:
	* **Vasoconstriction**  
	* **Platelet** activation and **aggregation**
	* **Loss** of **circulating volume**
* Result in other end-organ dysfunction
	* Laryngeal oedema
	* Cardiac
		* High cardiac output state with inappropriate SVR
		* Diastolic dysfunction
		* Decreased venous capacitance  
		Subsequently, generally normal filling pressures.
		Risk of acute LV failure if diastolic dysfunction present, especially if given volume.
	* Retinal vasospasm
	* Cerebral
		* Oedema
		* Haemorrhage
	* Renal
		* Oliguria
		* Uraemia
	* Hepatic
		* Synthetic coagulopathy
	* Haematological
		* Consumptive coagulopathy

###Aetiology
##Assessment{#clinical}
Pre-eclampsia is classified by:
* Gestational age at diagnosis
	* Late  
	≥37 weeks.
		* Majority of cases
	* Preterm  
	34-37 weeks.
	* Early  
	<34 weeks.
* Severity
	* **Preeclampsia**  
	Gestational hypertension with organ system involvement:
		* Cardiorespiratory
		* CNS
		* GIT
		* Renal
			* Proteinuria >0.3g/24 hours
		* GIT
		* Uteroplacental circulation
	* **Preeclampsia with severe features**  
	Preeclampsia with *any* of the following features:
		* Cardiorespiratory 
			* Severe hypertension  
			Defined as SBP > 160mmHg or DBP > 90mmHg.
			* Hypertensive crisis  
			Defined as SBP >180mmHg or DBP >110mmHg.
			* Pulmonary oedema
		* CNS
			* Seizures/eclampsia
			* HEadache
			* Visual disturbances
			* Papilloedema
			* Clonus/hyperreflexia
		* Renal
			* Proteinuria  
			≥5g/24 hours.
			* Oliguria  
			< 500ml/24 hours.
			* Protein/creatinine >0.5g/mmol.
			* Renal failure
		* GIT
			* Elevated transaminases
			* Hepatic tenderness
			* Nausea/vomiting
		* Haematological
			* Haemolysis
			* Thrombocytopenia  
			<100 x 10<sup>9</sup>sup>/L.
			* DIC
		* Uteroplacental circulation
			* Placental abruption
			* IUGR
			* Abnormal umbilical/uterine blood flow  
			Absent or reversed end-diastolic flow.
		* HELLP syndrome  
		Haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopaenia.
	* Generally a high-cardiac output state, associated with inappopriately high SVR


###History
###Examination
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
Preventative therapy:
* Limit intravenous fluid  
IV fluid increases risk of APO.
	* Avoid if:
		* Euvolaemic
		* Renal function normal 
* Avoid NSAIDs  
Reduce APO risk.

Treatment revolves around:
* Control of blood pressure
	* Target SBP 140-150mmHg and DBP 90-100mmHg
	* Strategy depends on severity of hypertension
		* For non-severe hypertension:
			* Labetalol 100-200mg PO BD-TDS  
			Drug of choice.
			* Nifedipine 10-20mg PO
			* Methyldopa
			* Metoprolol
			* Propranolol
		* For **severe hypertension** or **hypertensive crisis**:
		Aim to lower BP by 10-20mmHg every 10-20 minutes to reduce incidence of intracerebral haemorrhage.
			* Labetalol
			* Nifedipine
			* Hydralazine  
			* GTN  
			For hypertension and APO
		* Safe agents in pregnancy include
			* Labetalol
* Planning for delivery  
	* Only curative option
	* Neuraxial techniques preferred in absence of coagulopathy  
	No clear advantage of any (CSE, epidural, single-shot spinal) technique.

* Managing complications
	* Magnesium Sulphate
		* **Prophylaxis** for **eclampsia** in women with **severe preeclampsia**  
		Not recommended for use as an antihypertensive agent.
		* Multifactorial mechanism of action:
			* Increased prostacyclin syntehsis
			* Decreases calcium influx  
			Thereby decreasing ATP-consuming Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes.
			* NMDA antagonism

###Breastfeeding and Post-Partum Management
Ongoing and new-onset hypertension occur in the post-partum period. In addition to drugs used antenatally, drugs with low milk:maternal plasma ratios include:
* Enalapril
* Captopril

###Eclampsia
* A
	* Airway protection  
	Prevention of aspiration.
* C
* D
	* Anticonvulsant  
		* Magnesium Sulfate

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* A
	* Laryngeal oedema
		* Note presence of stridor pre-induction
		* Use a smaller ETT
* C
	* Hypertension
		* Management is difficult
		* Hypertension with light GA/laryngoscopy may be problematic
		* Key questions:
			* What is the current BP?
			* What is the trend in the BP?
			* What antihypertensive agents is the patient taking?
	* Volume state  
	May have ↓ intravascular volume; **↑ hypotension with neuraxial techniques**.
* D
	* Liklihood of eclampsia  
	Evaluate presence of:
		* Headache
		* Hyperreflexia/clonus
		* Visual symptoms
		* Extreme hypertension
	* Anaesthetic technique
		* Epidural
			* Reduces BP, and improves placental perfusion
			* Provides analgesia during labour
			* Slow titration may be **better than spinal** in severe preeclampsia
			* Consider inserting early, prior to thrombocytopenia developing
			* Requires **normal coagulation profile prior**
				* Platelet count > 70,000/ml  
				Institutional policy may differ.
				* Routine APTT/PT is not required unless:
					* Clinical history of bleeding
					* Other clinical condition that may contribute to coagulopathy
		* Spinal
			* Safe alternative
			* May require additional volume to compensate for the low-volume pre-eclamptic state
		* CSE
			* Preferable to spinal if surgery is long
		* GA
			* RSI associated with dangerous hypertension  
			Consider:
				* Labetalol 1mg/kg pre-induction  
				Reduces BP without affecting foetal blood flow.
			* Magnesium increases sensitivity to muscle relaxants
* F
	* Volume state
		* Urine output
		* Thirst
* H
	* Coagulation profile

	
##Complications
Maternal complications of severe pre-eclampsia include:
* Airway obstruction  
Vocal cord oedema due to decreased oncotic and increased hydrostatic pressure.
* Pulmonary oedema  
	* *Usually* due to low oncotic pressure or increased capillary permeability
	* Rarely due to diastolic dysfunction
* Cerebral haemorrhage
* Cerebral oedema
* Renal failure
* DIC
* Death
	* 40% due to cerebral oedema/haemorrhage
	* 40% due to pulmonary  
	Usually iatrogenic fluid overload.
	* Hepatic failure  
	Including hepatic rupture.


Foetal complications of pre-eclampsia include:
* IUGR
* FDIU
* Preterm birth
