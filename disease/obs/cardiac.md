#Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy
*This describes the general management of the pregnant patient with cardiac disease. Management of [peripartum cardiomyopathy](/disease/cvs/peripartum.md) is covered elsewhere.*

> Risk of pregnancy depends on specific disease and patients condition, individual counselling by experts is recommended

Pregnancy is a:
* Significant circulatory burden  
Achieving a term pregnancy demonstrates presence of physiological reserve.
* Time where underlying cardiac disease is diagnosed

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Prevalence:
* Mitral stenosis is the most common lesion in the pregnant patient  
Poorer prognosis with decompensated disease, i.e.:
	* AF
	* Pulmonary hypertension


Consequences:
* Neonate  
Complications occur in 20-38% of women with cardiac disease, with key risk factors being:
	* NYHA >II
	* Maternal LVOT obstruction
	* Smoking
	* Multiple gestation
	* Use of oral anticoagulants
	* Mechanical valve

###Risk Stratification
> Risk calculators include:
>* CARPEG
>* ZAHARA


Low (WHO I) risk:
* Cardiology followup limited to one or two visits
* Includes:
	* Uncomplicated or mild:
		* PS
		* PDA
		* MV prolapse
	* Repaired lesions
	* Isolated ectopics



Moderate (WHO II) risk:
* Require cardiology followup every trimester
* Includes:
	* Uncorrected ASD or VSD
	* Repaired ToF
	* Most arrhythmias



Moderate-severe (WHO II-III) risk:
* Classification depends on individual presentation
* Includes:
	* Mild LV dysfunction
	* HCM
	* Valvular heart disease that is not WHO I or WHO IV
	* Repaired coarctation



Severe (WHO III) risk:
* High risk of complications requiring *at least* monthly cardiology and obstetric review
* Mechanical valve
* Systemic RV/Fontan
* Cyanotic heart disease
* Other complex congenital heart disease
* Aortic dilatation 40-45mm in Marfan's
* Aortic dilatation 45-50mm with bicuspid AV



Critical (WHO IV) risk:
* Pregnancy contraindicated  
Pregnant women who will not consider termination require at least monthly review.
* Includes:
	* PAH
	* Severe LV dysfunction  
	NYHA III-IV or LVEF <30%.
	* Previous peripartum cardiomyopathy
	* Severe MS
	* Severe symptomatic AS
	* Marfan's with aorta ⩾45mm
	* Aortic dilatation ⩾50mm with bicuspid AV
	* Severe coarctation



###Contraindications to Pregnancy  
Disease of such risk that pregnancy is considered a contraindication include:
* Severe Pulmonary Hypertension  
Mortality up to 50%.
* Severe obstructive cardiac disease
	* HOCM
	* Aortic stenosis
	* Mitral stenosis
	* Pulmonary stenosis
	* Unrepaired coarctation
* NYHA III or IV heart failure
* Marfan's disease with aortic root ≥4cm


##Pathophysiology
###Aetiology
##Clinical Manifestations
Assessment aims are to determine level of function:
* Exercise tolerance
* HR, BP, and SpO<sub>2</sub>
* Medical therapy  
With particular attention to:
	* Amiodarone
	* Warfarin
	* ACE-I/A2RBs


##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
Key investigations include:
* Bloods
	* Haemoglobin
	* Coagulation status
* ECG
* Echocardiogram
* Cardiac MRI


##Management
Principles of management:
* Optimise underlying cardiac disease  
Manage the lesion.
	* Note prognosis is often worse due to the higher CO demand
* Echocardiography for any pregnant patient with new or changing symptoms
* If requiring surgery, delivery should be considered after 28 weeks

Delivery:
* Vaginal deliver preferred in:
	* Severe hypertension  
	Aim for a "stress free" labour.
		* Early epidural is recommended  
		Beware the fixed cardiac-output state.
* Caesarian delivery considered in:
	* Aortic dilation >45mm
	* Severe AS
	* Pre-term labour on anticoagulants
	* Eisenmenger's syndrome
	* Severe heart failure

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* C
	* Nature of lesion
		* Shunts  
		Required SpO<sub>2</sub> and ETCO<sub>2</sub>.
		* Air embolisation
	* Vascular access
	* **Circulation goals**
		* Enhance pulmonary flow
		* Optimise CO
		* Optimise oxygenation
* D
	* Anaesthetic technique
		* Regional
			* Advantages
				* Partner in room
				* Avoids risks of GA
				* Allows slow titration of anaesthetic  
				CSE or epidural.
				* Better post-operative analgesia
				* Reduced blood loss
				* Reduced PONV
			* Disadvantages
				* Anticoagulation
				* Maternal anxiety  
				Subsequent CVS effects.
				* Complications of regional
				* Cannot give 100% oxygen
		* General
			* Advantages
				* Anticoagulation status not relevant
				* Reduced maternal anxiety
				* Easier invasive vascular access
				* Facilitate DCR
			* Disadvantages
				* Airway and ventilation risks
				* Haemodynamic perturbance  
				Especially at intubation and extubation.
				* Effect of anaesthetic agents
					* Negative inotropy
					* Cardiac conduction abnormalities
					* Reduced SVR
					* Tocolysis
				* Risk of awareness
				* Greater blood loss
				* Poorer post-operative analgesia, PONV
* I
	* Endocarditis prophylaxis  
	Required in the setting of:
		* Unrepaired cyanotic CHD
		* Repaired CHD with prosthesis  
		In first 6 months.
		* Repaired CHD with residual defects	

###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
Consequences of cardiac disease in pregancy include:
* Maternal
	* Arrhythmias
	* Heart failure
	* Embolism  
	* CVA
	* Death
* Foetal
	* SGA
	* Prematurity
	* Death
