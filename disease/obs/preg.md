#Pregnancy and Labour

Period of time during which a child develops inside a woman. Pregnancy is:
* Normally 37-42 weeks
* Divided into trimesters
	* First trimester  
	0-12 weeks. The first trimester:
		* Has the highest rate of misscarriage
	* Second trimester  
	13-28 weeks. The second trimester:
		* Foetal movement begins
	* Third trimester  
	29-40 weeks.

##Physiology of Pregnancy{#physiol}
Physiological changes and their implications can be classified by system:
* Respiratory
	* MV  
	Increases; increases uptake of volatile agents.
	* FRC  
	Decreases; decreases safe apnoea time.
	* RV  
	Decreases; increases atelectasis and shunt.
	* VO<sub>2</sub>  
	Increases; decreases safe apnoea time.
* CVS
	* Cardiac output  
	Increases up to 40%; decreased physiological reserve.
	* Heart rate  
	Increases by 15-20 bpm; decreased reserve and coronary perfusion time.
	* SVR  
	Decreases.
	* BP  
	Decreases.
	* Volume  
	Increased circulating volume.
	* Other  
	Aortocaval compression by uterus reduces CO in supine position; can be reduced by placing tilt under **right** hip.
* Endocrine  
	* Insulin  
	Increased production and resistance; gestational diabetes.
	* Thyroid hormones  
	Increased; incidence of hyperthyroidism.
* Renal
	* Renal blood flow  
	Increased; natriuresis.
	* Blader emptying  
	Decreased; increased UTI.
* GIT
	* Bowel  
	Displaced into upper abdomen; increases reflux risk.
* Hepatic  
	* Plasma cholinesterase  
	Decreases; increased duration of suxamethonium.
	* Albumin  
	Decreased; altered pharmacokinetics via change in protein binding, increased peripheral oedema.
	* Biliary  
	Decreased gallbladder contractility; biliary stasis.
* Haematological
	* Haemoglobin  
	Decreases due to dilution; may be confused with haemorrhage.
	* White Cell Count  
	Increases; may mimic infection.
	* Coagulation factors  
	Increases; increases thrombosis risk.
* Immunological
	* Cell mediated immunity  
	Decreased; increased viral infections.

###Physiology of Labour
Labour is divided into **three stages**:
* **First stage**  
Covers the process of cervical dilation (0-10cm).
	* Involves:
		* Cervical dilation
		* Cervical effacement
		* Desent of the presenting part
	* **Normal** progress  
	Based on rate of cervical dilation, should be **>1cm/hr**.
		* 0.5cm/hr is 10<sup>th</sup> centile, and is often accepted
* **Second stage**  
Covers full dilation to delivery.
	* Involves:
		* Flexion
		* Descent
		* Rotation of the presenting part  
		Head moulds, flexes, and rotates through the birth canal.
			* Head should be delivered occiput-anterior (OA); i.e. **face-down**
			* Head has to rotate through the pelvis as the pelvic inlet is widest in the transverse diameter, and the outlet in the A-P diameter
	* Normal progress  
	**Delivery** should occur:
		* **Within 2 hours** of full dilation without epidural
		* Within **3 hours with epidural**
* **Third stage**  
Delivery of the placenta.



##Management
Divided into:
* [Drugs in pregnancy](#drugs)
	* Risks
	* Risk categorisation of drugs
	* Examples
* [Labour](#labour)
	* Induction of labour
	* Premature labour
	* Foetal distress


###Drugs in Pregnancy{#drugs}
Drugs in pregnancy are:
* Used by 20-25% of women regularly
* Often not validated for use or safety, including anaesthetic drugs  
Drug trials are difficult to perform in pregnant women.

Drug interactions in pregnancy can be classified into:
* Pharmcokinetic
	* Absorption
		* PO absorption affected by nausea and vomiting
	* Distribution
		* Increased V<sub>D</sub> of water soluble drugs  
		Due to increased blood and body fluid volume.
		* Increased free portion of acidic drugs  
		Due to decreased albumin.
	* Elimination
		* Increased renal clearance  
		Due to high GFR.
* Pharmacodynamic  
Most unchanged, except for:
	* Volatiles  
	Decreased MAC.
	* Local anaesthetics  
	Decreased neuraxial LA requirement.

* Foetal transfer via placenta
	* Almost all drugs cross the placenta to a certain degree  
	* Major determinants are concentration gradient, molecular weight, lipid solubility, degree of ionisation, protein binding, uteroplacental blood flow.
* Foetal transfer via breast milk


####Risk of Drugs in Pregnancy
Extent of effect depends on timing of consumption:
* 0-2 weeks  
Generally all or nothing effect:
	* Brief slowing of gestation with no overt ill effect
	* Spontaneous abortion  
* 3-8 weeks  
Period of organogenesis and potential for major abnormalities.
* Over 8 weeks  
Foetal period, effects include:
	* Physiological abnormalities
	* Minor morphological abnormalities

####Risk Categorisation System
The Australian risk categorisation divides drugs into:
* Category A  
Taken by a **large number** of pregnant women **without any observed increase in malformations** or other harmful effects.
* Category B  
Drugs which have been taken by a **limited number** of pregnant women, **without any increase in the frequency of malformations** or other harmful effects. Divided into three **subgroups based on animal data**:
	* B1  
	No observed foetal malformations in animals.
	* B2  
	No observed foetal malformations in animals, but studies were inadequate/data was lacking.
	* B3  
	Increased foetal abnormalities in animals, of uncertain human significance.
* Category C  
Caused/suspected to have **caused *potentially reversible* harmful foetal effects**.
* Category D  
Caused/suspected to have **caused increased foetal malformations** or **permanent** damage.
* Category X  
Such **high risk of causing foetal damage** that they should **not be used in pregnancy or** where there is a **possiblity of pregnancy**.

###Labour{#labour}
Management of abnormal labour depends on stage:
* Abnormal S1
	* Trial of oxytocin  
	Increases rate of dilation.
	* LUSCS  
	If concerns about:
		* Uterine rupture
		* Obstruction
		* Power of contraction
		* Foetus
* Abnormal S2
	* Trial of oxytocin  
	Increase uterine contractility.
	* Operative vaginal delivery  
	Forceps, vacuum. Indications can be divided into:
		* Maternal  
			* Exhaustion
			* Contraindication to pushing
				* HTN
				* Cerebral aneurysm
		* Foetal
			* Distress  
			CTG, scalp pH, prolapse.
		* Failure to progress  
		Arrested descent. May be due to:
			* Mento-anterior (MA)  
			Failure to descend.
			* Occiput Posterior (OP)  
			Failure to rotate.
			* Other  
			Usually requires LUSCS.
	* LUSCS
* S3  
Active management of S3 significantly reduces PPH and maternal mortality. Active management involves:
	* Prophylactic oxytocin  
	Upon delivery of the anterior shoulder.
	* Early cord clamping
	* Controlled cord traction


####Induction of Labour{#induction}
Artificial techniques to initiate the process of labour. Induction is performed:
* For:
	* Pregnancy reasons
		* PD
		* Twin pregnancy > 38 weeks
		* PROM  
		See [premature rupture of membranes](/anaesthesia/obs/terms.md)
		* FDIU
	* Maternal disease
		* [Preeclampsia](/disease/obs/htn.md)
		* Diabetes
	* Foetal
		* IUGR
* By:
	* Pharmaceutical means:
		* Intravaginal or endocervical prostaglandin
		* Intravenous oxytocin  
	* Non-pharmaceutical means:
		* Membrane sweep  
		Digital stimulation of the cervix to release endogenous prostaglandins.
		* AROM
		* Cervical ripening balloon


####Premature Labour{#preterm}
Premature:
* Labor occurs prior to 37 weeks gestation
* Birth occurs in ~10% of deliveries  
Associated with 85% of all perinatal morbidity and mortality, due to:
	* Respiratory distress syndrome
	* Intracranial haemorrhage
	* Ischaemic cerebral damage  
	Intrapartum:
		* Hypoxia
		* Asphyxia
		* Hypotension
	* Hypoglycaemia


Management of Premature Labour:
* **Tocolytics** are used to stop premature contractions  
Agents include:
	* Magnesium sulfate
	* Calcium channel blockers
	* Methylxanthines
	* Prostaglandin inhibitors
	* β-agonists
		* Evaluate for hyperkalemia if on treatment longer than 24 hours
	* Ethanol
		* Historical
		* Inhibits ADH, oxytocin, and myometrial contractility
* Consider epidural as anaesthetic technique
	* Reduces effects of systemic drugs on foetus
	* Improved foetal perfusion
	* May reduce incidence of ICH by allowing controlled delivery


####Foetal distress
* Avoid aortocaval compression
* Supplemental oxygen
* Treat hypotension
* Cease oxytocin  
Generally decision of obstetric team.
* Consider tocolytics
	* Terbutaline 250μg IV/SC
	* Salbutamol 100μg IV
	* GTN 400μg SL
* Prepare for em LUSCS
